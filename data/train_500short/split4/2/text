1898-145715-0002 SHE WAS SO OLD THAT SHE ONLY HAD ONE EYE AND ONE TOOTH LEFT
1898-145715-0004 SHE FELT A LITTLE REASSURED AND WAS FURTHER CHEERED WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT HER PET CAT AND DOG HAD FOLLOWED HER
1898-145715-0006 AND HAVING ENFORCED HER ORDERS WITH THE MOST AWFUL THREATS IN CASE OF DISOBEDIENCE SHE VANISHED LEAVING THE LITTLE GIRL AT LIBERTY TO EXPLORE THE PALACE
1898-145715-0007 SEVERAL YEARS PASSED DURING WHICH TIME THE PRINCESS GREW ACCUSTOMED TO HER LONELY LIFE OBEYED THE FAIRY'S ORDERS AND BY DEGREES FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE COURT OF THE KING HER FATHER
1898-145715-0010 THE BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW INFORMED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THAT HE WAS YOUNG THE SON OF A POWERFUL KING AND THAT THE FAIRY LAGREE WHO OWED HIS PARENTS A GRUDGE
1898-145715-0014 LAGREE ON HER RETURN SOON FOUND OUT THE NEGLECT AND SEEMED ONLY TOO PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HER SPITE TO HER LOVELY PRISONER
1898-145715-0016 AND EATING ANY YOUNG GIRLS OUR HEROINE OBEYED WITH GREAT SWEETNESS AND WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER LOVER
1898-145715-0017 AS TO CERTAIN DEATH AS SHE WAS CROSSING A WOOD A BIRD SANG TO HER TO PICK UP A SHINING PEBBLE WHICH SHE WOULD FIND IN A FOUNTAIN CLOSE BY AND TO USE IT WHEN NEEDED
1898-145715-0019 SHE READILY LET FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAVE THE FIRE
1898-145715-0021 THE RAINBOW APPEARED AS CLEARLY AS IT HAD EVER DONE IN THE FOUNTAIN BY THIS MEANS THEY WERE ABLE TO MEET WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE FIRE OR OF THE TWO BOTTLES IN WHICH THE OLD FAIRY KEPT HER EYE AND HER TOOTH AT NIGHT
1898-145715-0030 AND ARRIVED JUST AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAD FALLEN FAST ASLEEP THIS TIME SHE MADE SURE OF CATCHING HER VICTIM BUT THE CAT SPIED HER OUT
1898-145715-0031 SHE FLEW AT LAGREE'S FACE AND TORE OUT HER ONLY EYE THUS DELIVERING THE PRINCESS FOR EVER FROM HER PERSECUTOR
1898-145715-0035 HERE AGAIN SHE RECEIVED A PRESENT WITH THE SAME INJUNCTIONS
1898-145715-0039 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO ENTER THIS CASTLE BUT BESIDES BEING HUNG A LITTLE ABOVE THE GROUND THERE SEEMED TO BE NEITHER DOORS NOR WINDOWS SHE HAD NO DOUBT THOUGH REALLY I CANNOT THINK WHY
1898-145715-0040 THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME IN WHICH TO USE THE NUT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER SHE OPENED IT AND OUT CAME A DIMINUTIVE HALL PORTER
1898-145715-0042 SHE ENTERED A MAGNIFICENT ROOM WHICH APPEARED TO OCCUPY THE ENTIRE CASTLE AND WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY GOLD AND JEWELLED STARS IN THE CEILING
1898-145715-0043 WHO NOW SAW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS REAL SHAPE
1898-145715-0044 ON OPENING IT FOUND THAT ALL THE SEEDS WERE AS MANY LITTLE VIOLINS WHICH FLEW UP IN THE VAULTED ROOF AND AT ONCE BEGAN PLAYING MELODIOUSLY
1898-145715-0046 AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WALLS OF THE ROOM EXPANDED AND OPENED OUT REVEALING A GOLDEN THRONE COVERED WITH JEWELS
1898-145715-0049 HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO PRESENT HER TO HIS MOTHER AND THE COURT
19-198-0000 NORTHANGER ABBEY
19-198-0001 THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O THREE AND INTENDED FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER IT WAS EVEN ADVERTISED
19-198-0002 NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
19-198-0008 SHE HAD A THIN AWKWARD FIGURE
19-198-0030 HER GREATEST DEFICIENCY WAS IN THE PENCIL SHE HAD NO NOTION OF DRAWING NOT ENOUGH EVEN TO ATTEMPT A SKETCH OF HER LOVER'S PROFILE THAT SHE MIGHT BE DETECTED IN THE DESIGN
19-198-0037 SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM
1970-28415-0002 BUT NOW THEY COULD TELL THE WHOLE WORLD FOR JESUS WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW THEY WERE GLAD THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE QUIET ANY LONGER
1970-28415-0003 AND WAS A CRY OF WELCOME THEY SHOUTED THE WORDS OF A PSALM HOSANNA TO THE SON OF DAVID
1970-28415-0005 SOME OF THE CROWDS BEGAN TO SHOUT WITH THE DISCIPLES A GREAT CRY OF HOSANNA WENT RINGING DOWN THE STREET EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE SAYING IT
1970-28415-0007 WHO IS THIS THEY ASKED OTHERS WHO KNEW HIM ANSWERED WHY THIS IS JESUS THE PROPHET FROM NAZARETH IN GALILEE
1970-28415-0008 THIS WAS HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND HIS HOUSE THESE WERE HIS FATHER'S PEOPLE AND HIS PEOPLE THE KING FOR WHOM THE JEWS HAD BEEN WAITING HAD COME AT LAST TO REIGN
1970-28415-0013 WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO DO THESE THINGS WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD ACT LIKE THIS SO FAR JESUS HAD NEVER SAID THAT HE WAS THE MESSIAH
1970-28415-0017 BUT JESUS ALWAYS HAD AN ANSWER WHICH SILENCED THEM ONCE THEY CAME AND ASKED SHOULD WE PAY TAXES TO THE ROMANS THAT WAS A HARD QUESTION
1970-28415-0018 EVERYBODY WOULD HATE HIM TOO BUT IF HE SAID THEY SHOULD NOT PAY THE TAXES WELL THEY COULD COUNT ON THE ROMAN GOVERNOR TO SETTLE WITH JESUS THEN
1970-28415-0023 WHERE PEOPLE WERE MAKING THEIR GIFTS TO GOD
1970-28415-0030 THESE PEOPLE WILL ALSO BE SURPRISED THEY WILL SAY LORD
1970-28415-0034 BUT SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS SAID THE WEEK WAS GOING BY
1970-28415-0039 THE OTHER DISCIPLES WILL ALL BE THERE AND THE SOLDIERS WON'T KNOW WHICH MAN TO TAKE BUT I WILL GO UP TO JESUS AND KISS HIM THE MAN I KISS WILL BE THE ONE YOU WANT
2136-5147-0004 BUT SHE MAY ALSO BE ABOUT THE MOST PERNICIOUS INMATE IMAGINABLE SHE MAY TEACH YOU A BAD ACCENT
2136-5147-0009 HOW IS MADAME I ASKED QUITE WELL I BELIEVE ANSWERED THE HOUSEKEEPER DRILY NOTHING THE MATTER THAT I KNOW OF SHE EAT ENOUGH FOR TWO TO DAY
2136-5147-0011 LOOKING DOWN FROM THE CORNERS OF HER EYES IN AN INTERESTING DEJECTION

2136-5147-0014 VOUS SAVEZ LES MALADES SEE NEVER VISITORS SHE REPLIED WITH A STARTLED SORT OF TARTNESS AND A MOMENTARY ENERGY BESIDES I CANNOT CONVERSE
2136-5147-0019 AND WITH HER HAND PRESSED TO HER EAR SAID VERY FAINTLY BE SO GOOD TO TELL YOUR FRIEND HOW YOU SEE ME AND HOW I SUFFER
2136-5147-0020 SINCE THE PAIN WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO REMAIN LONGER SO WITH A FEW WORDS OF COMFORT WHICH COULD NOT WELL BE REFUSED
2136-5147-0021 I RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM

2136-5147-0024 YES AND REALLY AUSTIN IT IS QUITE CLEAR YOU OUGHT TO MARRY YOU WANT SOME ONE TO TAKE THIS GIRL OUT AND LOOK AFTER HER AND WHO'S TO DO IT
2136-5147-0025 AND IT IS REALLY SUCH A PITY FOR SHE'S A VERY PRETTY CREATURE AND A CLEVER WOMAN COULD MAKE HER QUITE CHARMING
2136-5147-0026 EIGHT AND TWENTY YEARS AGO OR MORE WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS WELL YOU KNOW SHE HAS GOT EVER SO MUCH NOW
2136-5147-0037 AND THERE WAS A FUMBLING AT THE HANDLE BUT THE BOLT WAS OUT OF ORDER
226-122538-0003 AN HOUR AFTER SHE HAD READ IT SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD TO CAIRO EMBARKED AT ALEXANDRIA THE NEXT DAY LANDED AT BRINDISI
226-122538-0023 JANE STOOD AT THE WINDOW OF HER COMPARTMENT AS THE TRAIN STEAMED INTO CHARING CROSS THE DOCTOR WAS STATIONED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THE DOOR WHEN HER CARRIAGE CAME TO A STANDSTILL
226-122538-0033 HE WILL ALWAYS BE BLIND DEAR BUT LIFE HOLDS OTHER THINGS BESIDE SIGHT WE MUST NEVER SAY NO HOPE WILL HE LIVE THERE IS NO REASON HE SHOULD NOT LIVE
226-122538-0034 BUT HOW FAR LIFE WILL BE WORTH LIVING LARGELY DEPENDS UPON WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR HIM POOR CHAP DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HE IS MORE SHATTERED MENTALLY THAN PHYSICALLY

2416-152139-0045 IN HARLEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECRETING THEM SOMEWHERE THERE YOU PRETENDED TO BE MUCH DISAPPOINTED AT FINDING MOYNE OUT YOU HAD JUST COME FOR A LITTLE SOCIAL VISIT
2416-152139-0046 TO GET BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOME LIFE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES MISSUS MOYNE WAS GENUINELY PLEASED AND GRATEFUL

32-21631-0008 HE ATE TOO MANY DRIED APPLES WELL WELL BROWNIE BEAVER MURMURED AND HE STARTED TO ASK MISTER CROW A QUESTION BUT MISTER CROW INTERRUPTED HIM WITH MORE NEWS
32-21631-0016 HE WAS AFRAID THAT IF HE SAID ANOTHER WORD MISTER CROW WOULD GROW ANGRY AND FLY AWAY WITHOUT TELLING HIM ANY MORE NEWS
32-21631-0019 SO I SHALL NOT TELL YOU THE REST UNTIL NEXT SATURDAY YOU SEE YOU HAVE A FEW THINGS TO LEARN ABOUT TAKING A NEWSPAPER
3242-8112-0000 MANTELISH EXCUSED HIMSELF AND WENT OFF WITH THE MESSENGER THE DOOR CLOSED QUILLAN CAME BACK TO HIS CHAIR WE'RE MOVING THE OUTFIT LATER TONIGHT THE COMMISSIONER EXPLAINED
3242-8112-0009 SOMEBODY WOULD GET THAT WORKED OUT PRETTY SOON WOULDN'T THEY
3242-8112-0011 SAME HERE THE PLASMOID NABOB AGREED UNGRATEFULLY WEIRD BEASTIES BUT LET'S SEE AT PRESENT THERE ARE TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MEMBER WORLDS TO THE FEDERATION AREN'T THERE MORE OR LESS
3242-8112-0013 THEY'VE ALL BEEN TOLD WE'RE HEADING FOR A NEW GOLDEN AGE COURTESY OF THE PLASMOID SCIENCE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY HAS BELIEVED IT NOW THERE'S CONSIDERABLE DOUBT
3242-8112-0015 SO ANY ONE OF UMPTEEN THOUSANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN THE HUB MIGHT BE THE ONE THAT HAS THAT PLASMOID NOW INCLUDING SAID HOLATI ANY ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN RESTRICTED WORLDS
3242-8112-0018 RIGHT THERE ON HARVEST MOON THEY DID HE SAID IT WAS FAYLE
3242-8112-0023 I WAS WATCHING IT MAJOR QUILLAN SAID REASSURINGLY FROM THE END OF THE TABLE
3242-8112-0024 MANTELISH BROUGHT IT BACK TO MACCADON WITH HIM
3242-8112-0025 HE WAS CURIOUS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T EVEN GUESS AT WHAT ITS FUNCTION WAS IT WAS JUST LYING THERE IN A CUBICLE SO HE DID CONSIDERABLE EXPERIMENTING WITH IT WHILE HE WAITED FOR GESS FAYLE TO SHOW UP
3242-8112-0027 TRIGGER SHOOK HER HEAD WONDERFUL SO
3242-8112-0030 HE WAS VISITING ANOTHER LAB WHERE THEY HAD A COUPLE OF PLASMOIDS WHICH ACTUALLY MOVED NOW AND THEN
3242-8112-0031 THE TWO LAB PLASMOIDS STOPPED MOVING WHILE HE WAS THERE THEY HAVEN'T MOVED SINCE
3242-8112-0032 RIGHT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND THEN LOCATED ANOTHER MOVING PLASMOID
3242-8112-0033 THE BIG ONE INDUCES PLASMOID ACTIVITY THE LITTLE ONE MODIFIES IT
3242-8112-0037 SO THEY NEED IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE KEY UNIT TRIGGER ASKED PROBABLY THAT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK VERY MUCH BETTER DOESN'T IT QUITE A LITTLE HE SAID THE UNIT MAY NOT WORK
3242-8112-0038 MANTELISH TALKS OF SOMETHING HE CALLS PROXIMITY INFLUENCE
3242-8112-0044 I CAN TELL YOU MOST OF WHAT I KNOW AT THE MOMENT SAID THE COMMISSIONER
332-128985-0003 THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGES
332-128985-0009 THIS STORY HOWEVER I REGARD WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DOUBT
332-128985-0015 BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO STRICT AND EXACTING DURING THE BUSINESS SESSIONS OF HIS PIRATICAL YEAR BY WHICH I MEAN WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND AFTER PRIZES HE WAS VERY MUCH MORE DISAGREEABLE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A VACATION
332-128985-0025 THEN THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO BUT TO GO ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS AND PUT OUT TO SEA IN SEARCH OF SOME FRESH PRIZE SO FAR ROC'S CAREER HAD BEEN VERY MUCH LIKE THAT OF MANY OTHER COMPANIONS OF THE COAST
332-128985-0026 DIFFERING FROM THEM ONLY IN RESPECT TO INTENSITY AND FORCE BUT HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WITH IDEAS
332-128985-0027 HE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURING
332-128985-0029 AND HAD SENT THAT MILD MANNERED OBSERVER INTO THE HARBOR TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
332-128985-0031 AND WITH A GOOD MANY MORE BROAD BACKED HAIRY MARINERS THAN WERE NECESSARY PULLING AT THE OARS THAN THEY GAVE THE ALARM
332-128985-0033 WHEN THE PIRATE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF PUTTING THEM TO TRIAL BUCCANEERS WERE OUTLAWED BY THE SPANISH
332-128985-0035 DURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATES
332-128985-0037 OR JUMPING OVERBOARD WITH A COUPLE OF WINE JARS FOR A LIFE PRESERVER OR OF DOING ANY OF THOSE ORDINARY THINGS WHICH PIRATES WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHEN ESCAPING FROM THEIR CAPTORS
332-128985-0038 INSIDE OF A FORTRESS AND IF THEY ESCAPED FROM THIS THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF A BODY OF SPANISH SOLDIERS THEIR STOUT ARMS AND THEIR STOUT HEARTS WERE OF NO USE TO THEM NOW
332-128985-0039 AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVE
332-128985-0040 WHO CAME IN TO BRING HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND BY THE MEANS OF THIS MAN THE PIRATE HOPED TO PLAY A TRICK UPON THE GOVERNOR HE PROMISED THE SLAVE THAT IF HE WOULD HELP HIM AND HE TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO SO
332-128985-0042 AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO BRING SOME WRITING MATERIALS TO ROC WHO THEREUPON BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF A LETTER
332-128985-0043 WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN
332-128985-0050 HAVING FULFILLED HIS MISSION HE DEPARTED AND WHEN SEEN AGAIN HE WAS THE SAME SERVANT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO CARRY FOOD TO THE PRISONERS THE GOVERNOR READ THE LETTER WITH A DISQUIETED MIND
332-128985-0052 AND HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO GREAT SPANISH FORCE IN THE HARBOR AT THAT TIME AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUCCANEERING VESSELS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER TOGETHER IN THE BAY
332-128985-0067 THEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE OATHS THEY HAD TAKEN TO ABANDON PIRACY THAN THEY THOUGHT OF THE OATHS WHICH THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING RIGHT AND LEFT
332-128985-0068 BUT AS SOON AS THEY COULD MANAGE IT THEY SAILED BACK TO THE WEST INDIES AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN JAMAICA
332-128985-0072 FROM THE ACTIVE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION
332-128985-0077 IN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTED
332-128985-0078 AND THEY WERE THEREFORE GREATLY DISMAYED WHEN A PARTY OF HORSEMEN FROM THE TOWN WHO HAD MADE A WIDE DETOUR THROUGH THE WOODS SUDDENLY CHARGED UPON THEIR REAR
332-128985-0082 COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
332-128985-0088 AND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLES
3526-176653-0012 WHERE NO ANSWER WHAT'S YOUR NAME LITTLE GIRL AND STILL SHE STARED
3526-176653-0015 HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY A LONG CRY CAME DOWN THE RAVINE
3526-176653-0018 HAVE YOU GOT A FATHER LIKE A FLASH HER WHOLE FACE CHANGED
3526-176653-0020 THE GIANT'S HEAVY EYES LIFTED QUICKLY BUT HE SPOKE TO THE GIRL YOU GO ON HOME
3526-176653-0021 THE GIRL SHRANK TO THE BUSHES BUT SHE CRIED SHARPLY BACK DON'T YOU HURT HIM NOW DAD HE AIN'T EVEN GOT A PISTOL HE AIN'T NO SHET UP
3526-176653-0023 FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS SILENCE AND A PUZZLED FROWN GATHERED ON THE MOUNTAINEER'S FACE THAT'S A BRIGHT LITTLE GIRL OF YOURS
3526-176653-0028 I MIGHT HAVE A GUN MYSELF SOMETIMES DID YOU THINK YOU COULD SCARE ME THE MOUNTAINEER STARED IN GENUINE SURPRISE TWUSN'T NO JOKE HE SAID SHORTLY
3526-176653-0035 HE WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND HE WOULD GO UP AND SEE THE LITTLE GIRL AND THE GIANT AGAIN AND GET THAT PROMISED DRAM ONCE MORE HOWEVER HE LET HIS MINNOW FLOAT DOWN INTO THE SHADOW OF A BIG ROCK
3526-176653-0036 A MAN WITH A WOMAN BEHIND HIM BOTH OLD AND SPECTACLED ALL THREE MOTIONLESS ON THE BANK AND LOOKING AT HIM
3526-176653-0038 AND THEN SHE SAID IN A COMMANDING UNDERTONE GO ON BILLY
3526-176653-0039 HALE SMILED HE LOVED OLD PEOPLE AND TWO KINDER FACES HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO GENTLER VOICES HE HAD NEVER HEARD
3526-176653-0046 GEE HAW I TELL YE AN OX WAGON EVIDENTLY WAS COMING ON AND THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW THAT HE TURNED HIS HORSE INTO THE BUSHES TO LET IT PASS
3526-176653-0047 STILL THERE WAS NO SOUND OF OX OR WAGON AND THE VOICE SOUNDED LIKE A CHILD'S SO HE WENT ON AT A WALK IN THE THICK SAND AND WHEN HE TURNED THE BUSHES HE PULLED UP AGAIN WITH A LOW LAUGH
3526-176653-0049 THE BOY WAS USING THE SWITCH AS A GOAD AND DRIVING THE FROG AS AN OX AND HE WAS AS EARNEST AS THOUGH BOTH WERE REAL I GIVE YE A LITTLE REST NOW BUCK HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD EARNESTLY
3526-176653-0050 GEE GEE THE FROG HOPPED SEVERAL TIMES
3526-176653-0051 SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW PANTING IN SYMPATHY
