3526-176653-0000 THE FERNS DRENCHED HIS STIRRUPS AS HE BRUSHED THROUGH THEM AND EACH DRIPPING TREE TOP BROKE THE SUNLIGHT AND LET IT DROP IN TENT LIKE BEAMS THROUGH THE SHIMMERING UNDERMIST A BIRD FLASHED HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE GREEN GLOOM
3526-176653-0001 BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND IN THE AIR BUT THE FOOTFALLS OF HIS HORSE AND THE EASY CREAKING OF LEATHER UNDER HIM THE DRIP OF DEW OVERHEAD AND THE RUNNING OF WATER BELOW NOW AND THEN HE COULD SEE THE SAME SLENDER FOOT PRINTS IN THE RICH LOAM
3526-176653-0002 AND HE SAW THEM IN THE SAND WHERE THE FIRST TINY BROOK TINKLED ACROSS THE PATH FROM A GLOOMY RAVINE THERE THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD TAKEN A FLYING LEAP ACROSS IT AND BEYOND HE COULD SEE THE PRINTS NO MORE HE LITTLE GUESSED THAT WHILE HE HALTED TO LET HIS HORSE DRINK
3526-176653-0003 HE TURNED BACK UP THE CREEK AND PASSED SO CLOSE TO WHERE SHE HAD SLIPPED ASIDE INTO THE BUSHES THAT SHE CAME NEAR SHRIEKING BUT HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON A POOL OF THE CREEK ABOVE AND TO HER WONDER HE STROLLED STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER WITH HIS BOOTS ON
3526-176653-0004 PUSHING THE NET IN FRONT OF HIM HE WAS A RAIDER SURE SHE THOUGHT NOW AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A MOONSHINE STILL AND THE WILD LITTLE THING IN THE BUSHES SMILED CUNNINGLY THERE WAS NO STILL UP THAT CREEK
3526-176653-0005 AND AS HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BELOW AND HIS GUN SHE WAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK WHICH HE DID BY AND BY DRIPPING AND SOAKED TO HIS KNEES THEN SHE SAW HIM UNTIE THE QUEER GUN ON HIS SADDLE PULL IT OUT OF A CASE AND
3526-176653-0006 HER EYES GOT BIG WITH WONDER TAKE IT TO PIECES AND MAKE IT INTO A LONG LIMBER ROD IN A MOMENT HE HAD CAST A MINNOW INTO THE POOL AND WADED OUT INTO THE WATER UP TO HIS HIPS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO QUEER A FISHING POLE SO QUEER A FISHERMAN
3526-176653-0007 HOW COULD HE GET A FISH OUT WITH THAT LITTLE SWITCH SHE THOUGHT CONTEMPTUOUSLY BY AND BY SOMETHING HUMMED QUEERLY THE MAN GAVE A SLIGHT JERK AND A SHINING FISH FLOPPED TWO FEET INTO THE AIR IT WAS SURELY VERY QUEER
3526-176653-0008 BUT STOOD STILL WINDING SOMETHING WITH ONE HAND AND AGAIN THE FISH WOULD FLASH INTO THE AIR AND THEN THAT HUMMING WOULD START AGAIN WHILE THE FISHERMAN WOULD STAND QUIET AND WAITING FOR A WHILE AND THEN HE WOULD BEGIN TO WIND AGAIN IN HER WONDER
3526-176653-0009 DROWNING HIM STEPPING BACKWARD AT THE SAME TIME AND A MOMENT LATER THE FISH SLID EASILY OUT OF THE EDGE OF THE WATER GASPING ALONG THE EDGE OF A LOW SAND BANK AND THE FISHERMAN REACHING DOWN WITH ONE HAND CAUGHT HIM IN THE GILLS THEN
3526-176653-0010 HE LOOKED UP AND SMILED AND SHE HAD SEEN NO SMILE LIKE THAT BEFORE HOWDYE LITTLE GIRL ONE BARE TOE WENT BURROWING SUDDENLY INTO THE SAND ONE FINGER WENT TO HER RED MOUTH AND THAT WAS ALL

3526-176653-0015 HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY A LONG CRY CAME DOWN THE RAVINE

3526-176653-0019 DRAWLED A VOICE FROM THE BUSHES AND IT HAD A TONE THAT MADE THE FISHERMAN WHIRL SUDDENLY A GIANT MOUNTAINEER STOOD ON THE BANK ABOVE HIM WITH A WINCHESTER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM HOW ARE YOU
3526-176653-0020 THE GIANT'S HEAVY EYES LIFTED QUICKLY BUT HE SPOKE TO THE GIRL YOU GO ON HOME
3526-176653-0021 THE GIRL SHRANK TO THE BUSHES BUT SHE CRIED SHARPLY BACK DON'T YOU HURT HIM NOW DAD HE AIN'T EVEN GOT A PISTOL HE AIN'T NO SHET UP
3526-176653-0022 THE LITTLE CREATURE VANISHED AND THE MOUNTAINEER TURNED TO THE FISHERMAN WHO HAD JUST PUT ON A FRESH MINNOW AND TOSSED IT INTO THE RIVER PURTY WELL THANK YOU HE SAID SHORTLY HOW ARE YOU FINE WAS THE NONCHALANT ANSWER
3526-176653-0023 FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS SILENCE AND A PUZZLED FROWN GATHERED ON THE MOUNTAINEER'S FACE THAT'S A BRIGHT LITTLE GIRL OF YOURS

3526-176653-0034 HE LIKED THAT AND HER HAIR IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE GOLD BRONZE ON THE WING OF A WILD TURKEY THAT HE HAD SHOT THE DAY BEFORE WELL IT WAS NOON NOW THE FISH HAD STOPPED BITING AFTER THE WAYWARD FASHION OF BASS
3526-176653-0035 HE WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND HE WOULD GO UP AND SEE THE LITTLE GIRL AND THE GIANT AGAIN AND GET THAT PROMISED DRAM ONCE MORE HOWEVER HE LET HIS MINNOW FLOAT DOWN INTO THE SHADOW OF A BIG ROCK
3526-176653-0036 A MAN WITH A WOMAN BEHIND HIM BOTH OLD AND SPECTACLED ALL THREE MOTIONLESS ON THE BANK AND LOOKING AT HIM
3526-176653-0037 ONLY ONE ANSWERED HALE WITH EQUAL CHEER THE OLD WOMAN PUSHED BACK HER BONNET AS HE WADED THROUGH THE WATER TOWARDS THEM AND HE SAW THAT SHE WAS PUFFING A CLAY PIPE SHE LOOKED AT THE FISHERMAN AND HIS TACKLE WITH THE NAIVE WONDER OF A CHILD
3526-176653-0038 AND THEN SHE SAID IN A COMMANDING UNDERTONE GO ON BILLY
3526-176653-0039 HALE SMILED HE LOVED OLD PEOPLE AND TWO KINDER FACES HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO GENTLER VOICES HE HAD NEVER HEARD
3526-176653-0040 SAID THE OLD MAN CHUCKLING BUT THAR'S A SIGHT OF EM DOWN THAR BELOW MY OLD MILL QUIETLY THE OLD WOMAN HIT THE HORSE WITH A STRIPPED BRANCH OF ELM AND THE OLD GRAY WITH A SWITCH OF HIS TAIL STARTED

3526-176653-0042 THE OLD MAN REMONSTRATING IN THE KINDLIEST WAY THE OLD WOMAN SILENTLY PUFFING HER PIPE AND MAKING NO ANSWER EXCEPT TO FLAY GENTLY THE RUMP OF THE LAZY OLD GRAY HESITATING HARDLY A MOMENT HALE UNJOINTED HIS POLE
3526-176653-0043 LEFT HIS MINNOW BUCKET WHERE IT WAS MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE UP THE PATH ABOUT HIM THE BEECH LEAVES GAVE BACK THE GOLD OF THE AUTUMN SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE RAVINE HIGH UNDER THE CREST OF THE MOTTLED MOUNTAIN WAS ON FIRE WITH THE SCARLET OF MAPLE
3526-176653-0044 WHEN HE GOT TO THE BARE CREST OF A LITTLE RISE HE COULD SEE UP THE CREEK A SPIRAL OF BLUE RISING SWIFTLY FROM A STONE CHIMNEY GEESE AND DUCKS WERE HUNTING CRAWFISH IN THE LITTLE CREEK THAT RAN FROM A MILK HOUSE OF LOGS
3526-176653-0045 HALF HIDDEN BY WILLOWS AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND A TURN IN THE PATH BROUGHT INTO VIEW A LOG CABIN WELL CHINKED WITH STONES AND PLASTER AND WITH A WELL BUILT PORCH A FENCE RAN AROUND THE YARD
3526-176653-0046 GEE HAW I TELL YE AN OX WAGON EVIDENTLY WAS COMING ON AND THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW THAT HE TURNED HIS HORSE INTO THE BUSHES TO LET IT PASS
3526-176653-0047 STILL THERE WAS NO SOUND OF OX OR WAGON AND THE VOICE SOUNDED LIKE A CHILD'S SO HE WENT ON AT A WALK IN THE THICK SAND AND WHEN HE TURNED THE BUSHES HE PULLED UP AGAIN WITH A LOW LAUGH
3526-176653-0048 IN THE ROAD ACROSS THE CREEK WAS A CHUBBY TOW HAIRED BOY WITH A LONG SWITCH IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND A PINE DAGGER AND A STRING IN HIS LEFT ATTACHED TO THE STRING AND TIED BY ONE HIND LEG WAS A FROG
3526-176653-0049 THE BOY WAS USING THE SWITCH AS A GOAD AND DRIVING THE FROG AS AN OX AND HE WAS AS EARNEST AS THOUGH BOTH WERE REAL I GIVE YE A LITTLE REST NOW BUCK HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD EARNESTLY
3526-176653-0050 GEE GEE THE FROG HOPPED SEVERAL TIMES
3526-176653-0051 SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW PANTING IN SYMPATHY
3526-176653-0052 THEN HE LOOKED UP FOR AN INSTANT HE SEEMED TERRIFIED BUT HE DID NOT RUN INSTEAD HE STEALTHILY SHIFTED THE PINE DAGGER OVER TO HIS RIGHT HAND AND THE STRING TO HIS LEFT HERE BOY SAID THE FISHERMAN WITH AFFECTED STERNNESS
3526-176653-0053 WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT DAGGER THE BOY'S BREAST HEAVED AND HIS DIRTY FINGERS CLENCHED TIGHT AROUND THE WHITTLED STICK DON'T YOU TALK TO ME THAT A WAY HE SAID WITH AN OMINOUS SHAKE OF HIS HEAD I'LL GUT YE THE FISHERMAN THREW BACK HIS HEAD
3526-176653-0054 AND HIS PEAL OF LAUGHTER DID WHAT HIS STERNNESS FAILED TO DO THE LITTLE FELLOW WHEELED SUDDENLY AND HIS FEET SPURNED THE SAND AROUND THE BUSHES FOR HOME THE ASTONISHED FROG DRAGGED BUMPING AFTER HIM WELL
3664-178355-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN CHAMPION BUFFALO KILLER SHORTLY AFTER THE ADVENTURES MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER I HAD MY CELEBRATED BUFFALO HUNT WITH BILLY COMSTOCK A NOTED SCOUT GUIDE AND INTERPRETER
3664-178355-0001 WHO WAS THEN CHIEF OF SCOUTS AT FORT WALLACE KANSAS COMSTOCK HAD THE REPUTATION FOR A LONG TIME OF BEING A MOST SUCCESSFUL BUFFALO HUNTER AND THE OFFICERS IN PARTICULAR WHO HAD SEEN HIM KILL BUFFALOES WERE VERY DESIROUS OF BACKING HIM IN A MATCH AGAINST ME
3664-178355-0002 IT WAS ACCORDINGLY ARRANGED THAT I SHOULD SHOOT HIM A BUFFALO KILLING MATCH AND THE PRELIMINARIES WERE EASILY AND SATISFACTORILY AGREED UPON WE WERE TO HUNT ONE DAY OF EIGHT HOURS BEGINNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND CLOSING AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3664-178355-0003 THE WAGER WAS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A SIDE AND THE MAN WHO SHOULD KILL THE GREATER NUMBER OF BUFFALOES FROM ON HORSEBACK WAS TO BE DECLARED THE WINNER THE HUNT TOOK PLACE ABOUT TWENTY MILES EAST OF SHERIDAN AND AS IT HAD BEEN PRETTY WELL ADVERTISED AND NOISED ABROAD
3664-178355-0004 A LARGE CROWD WITNESSED THE INTERESTING AND EXCITING SCENE AN EXCURSION PARTY MOSTLY FROM SAINT LOUIS CONSISTING OF ABOUT A HUNDRED GENTLEMEN AND LADIES CAME OUT ON A SPECIAL TRAIN TO VIEW THE SPORT AND AMONG THE NUMBER WAS MY WIFE WITH LITTLE BABY ARTA
3664-178355-0005 THE BUFFALOES WERE QUITE PLENTY AND IT WAS AGREED THAT WE SHOULD GO INTO THE SAME HERD AT THE SAME TIME AND MAKE A RUN AS WE CALLED IT EACH ONE KILLING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE A REFEREE WAS TO FOLLOW EACH OF US ON HORSEBACK WHEN WE ENTERED THE HERD AND COUNT THE BUFFALOES KILLED BY EACH MAN
3664-178355-0006 WHEN THEY WERE TO COME UP AS NEAR AS THEY PLEASED AND WITNESS THE CHASE WE WERE FORTUNATE IN THE FIRST RUN IN GETTING GOOD GROUND COMSTOCK WAS MOUNTED ON ONE OF HIS FAVORITE HORSES WHILE I RODE OLD BRIGHAM I FELT CONFIDENT THAT I HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF COMSTOCK IN TWO THINGS
3664-178355-0007 FIRST I HAD THE BEST BUFFALO HORSE THAT EVER MADE A TRACK AND SECOND I WAS USING WHAT WAS KNOWN AT THAT TIME AS THE NEEDLE GUN A BREECH LOADING SPRINGFIELD RIFLE CALIBRE FIFTY IT WAS MY FAVORITE OLD LUCRETIA WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE NOTICE OF THE READER
3664-178355-0008 WHILE COMSTOCK WAS ARMED WITH A HENRY RIFLE AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD FIRE A FEW SHOTS QUICKER THAN I COULD YET I WAS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT IT DID NOT CARRY POWDER AND LEAD ENOUGH TO DO EXECUTION EQUAL TO MY CALIBRE FIFTY AT LAST THE TIME CAME TO BEGIN THE MATCH
3664-178355-0009 COMSTOCK AND I DASHED INTO A HERD FOLLOWED BY THE REFEREES THE BUFFALOES SEPARATED COMSTOCK TOOK THE LEFT BUNCH AND I THE RIGHT MY GREAT FORTE IN KILLING BUFFALOES FROM HORSEBACK WAS TO GET THEM CIRCLING BY RIDING MY HORSE AT THE HEAD OF THE HERD SHOOTING THE LEADERS
3664-178355-0010 TILL THEY WOULD FINALLY CIRCLE ROUND AND ROUND ON THIS MORNING THE BUFFALOES WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING
3664-178355-0011 I HAD NURSED MY BUFFALOES AS A BILLIARD PLAYER DOES THE BALLS WHEN HE MAKES A BIG RUN AFTER THE RESULT OF THE FIRST RUN HAD BEEN DULY ANNOUNCED OUR SAINT LOUIS EXCURSION FRIENDS WHO HAD APPROACHED TO THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD STOPPED SET OUT A LOT OF CHAMPAGNE WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM
3664-178355-0012 AND WHICH PROVED A GOOD DRINK ON A KANSAS PRAIRIE AND A BUFFALO HUNTER WAS A GOOD MAN TO GET AWAY WITH IT WHILE TAKING A SHORT REST WE SUDDENLY SPIED ANOTHER HERD OF BUFFALOES COMING TOWARD US IT WAS ONLY A SMALL DROVE AND WE AT ONCE PREPARED TO GIVE THE ANIMALS A LIVELY RECEPTION
3664-178355-0013 THEY PROVED TO BE A HERD OF COWS AND CALVES WHICH BY THE WAY ARE QUICKER IN THEIR MOVEMENTS THAN THE BULLS WE CHARGED IN AMONG THEM AND I CONCLUDED MY RUN WITH A SCORE OF EIGHTEEN WHILE COMSTOCK KILLED FOURTEEN
3664-178355-0014 WE CAME UP CLOSE TO ANOTHER HERD AS I WAS SO FAR AHEAD OF MY COMPETITOR IN THE NUMBER KILLED I THOUGHT I COULD AFFORD TO GIVE AN EXTRA EXHIBITION OF MY SKILL I HAD TOLD THE LADIES THAT I WOULD ON THE NEXT RUN RIDE MY HORSE WITHOUT SADDLE OR BRIDLE
3664-178355-0015 AND I REMEMBER ONE FAIR LADY WHO ENDEAVORED TO PREVAIL UPON ME NOT TO ATTEMPT IT THAT'S NOTHING AT ALL SAID I I HAVE DONE IT MANY A TIME AND OLD BRIGHAM KNOWS AS WELL AS I WHAT I AM DOING AND SOMETIMES A GREAT DEAL BETTER SO LEAVING MY SADDLE AND BRIDLE WITH THE WAGONS
3664-178355-0016 WE RODE TO THE WINDWARD OF THE BUFFALOES AS USUAL AND WHEN WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF THEM WE DASHED INTO THE HERD I SOON HAD THIRTEEN LAID OUT ON THE GROUND THE LAST ONE OF WHICH I HAD DRIVEN DOWN CLOSE TO THE WAGONS WHERE THE LADIES WERE
3664-178355-0017 IT FRIGHTENED SOME OF THE TENDER CREATURES TO SEE THE BUFFALO COMING AT FULL SPEED DIRECTLY TOWARD THEM BUT WHEN HE HAD GOT WITHIN FIFTY YARDS OF ONE OF THE WAGONS I SHOT HIM DEAD IN HIS TRACKS THIS MADE MY SIXTY NINTH BUFFALO AND FINISHED MY THIRD AND LAST RUN
3664-178355-0018 COMSTOCK HAVING KILLED FORTY SIX AS IT WAS NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON COMSTOCK AND HIS BACKERS GAVE UP THE IDEA THAT HE COULD BEAT ME AND THEREUPON THE REFEREES DECLARED ME THE WINNER OF THE MATCH
3664-178355-0019 THEY PREPARED TO DEPART HAVING DECLINED AN INVITATION TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE
3664-178355-0020 HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE INDIANS WHO OVERTOOK HIM AND HIS COMPANION WHEN THEY HAD GONE ABOUT HALF A MILE AFTER SURROUNDING THE TWO MEN THEY SUDDENLY ATTACKED THEM THEY KILLED SCALPED AND ROBBED COMSTOCK BUT GROVER ALTHOUGH SEVERELY WOUNDED MADE HIS ESCAPE
3664-178355-0021 OWING TO THE FLEETNESS OF THE EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS RIDING THIS SAD EVENT OCCURRED AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ON OUR WAY BACK TO CAMP WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE CHOICE MEAT AND FINEST HEADS
3664-178355-0022 IN THIS CONNECTION IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF PLACE TO STATE THAT DURING THE TIME I WAS HUNTING FOR THE KANSAS PACIFIC I ALWAYS BROUGHT INTO CAMP THE BEST BUFFALO HEADS AND TURNED THEM OVER TO THE COMPANY WHO FOUND A VERY GOOD USE FOR THEM THEY HAD THEM MOUNTED IN THE BEST POSSIBLE MANNER
3664-178355-0023 AND SENT THEM TO ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES AND RAILROAD CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY HAVING THEM PLACED IN PROMINENT POSITIONS AT THE LEADING HOTELS DEPOTS AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS AS A SORT OF TRADE MARK OR ADVERTISEMENT OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD
3664-178355-0024 AND TO DAY THEY ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE TRAVELER ALMOST EVERYWHERE WHENEVER I AM TRAVELING OVER THE COUNTRY AND SEE ONE OF THESE TRADE MARKS I FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN THAT I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF THE OLD FELLOW WHOSE BODY IT ONCE ORNAMENTED
3664-178355-0025 MY SERVICES AS A HUNTER WERE NOT ANY LONGER REQUIRED AT THIS TIME THERE WAS A GENERAL INDIAN WAR RAGING ALL ALONG THE WESTERN BORDERS GENERAL SHERIDAN HAD TAKEN UP HIS HEADQUARTERS AT FORT HAYES IN ORDER TO BE IN THE FIELD TO SUPERINTEND THE CAMPAIGN IN PERSON
3664-178355-0026 AS SCOUTS AND GUIDES WERE IN GREAT DEMAND I CONCLUDED ONCE MORE TO TAKE UP MY OLD AVOCATION OF SCOUTING AND GUIDING FOR THE ARMY HAVING NO SUITABLE PLACE IN WHICH TO LEAVE MY OLD AND FAITHFUL BUFFALO HUNTER BRIGHAM AND NOT WISHING TO KILL HIM BY SCOUTING
3664-178355-0027 I DETERMINED TO DISPOSE OF HIM I WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO PART WITH HIM BUT I CONSOLED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO RECEIVE HARDER USAGE IN OTHER HANDS THAN HE HAD IN MINE I HAD SEVERAL GOOD OFFERS TO SELL HIM
3664-178355-0028 BUT AT THE SUGGESTION OF SOME GENTLEMEN IN SHERIDAN ALL OF WHOM WERE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE HORSE I PUT HIM UP AT A RAFFLE IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM ALL AN EQUAL CHANCE OF BECOMING THE OWNER OF THE FAMOUS STEED THERE WERE TEN CHANCES AT THIRTY DOLLARS EACH AND THEY WERE ALL QUICKLY TAKEN
3664-178355-0029 A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS MADE UP TO BE GIVEN TO THE HORSE THAT COULD FIRST REACH WYANDOTTE FOUR MILES DISTANT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AND BRIGHAM WAS ENTERED AS ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS FOR THE PURSE
3664-178355-0030 EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT MISTER BONHAM WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE WAS TO RIDE THAT POKY LOOKING PLUG AGAINST THE FIVE THOROUGHBREDS WHICH WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE RACE WHEN ALL THE PRELIMINARIES HAD BEEN ARRANGED THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN AND OFF WENT THE HORSES FOR WYANDOTTE
3664-178355-0031 FOR THE FIRST HALF MILE SEVERAL OF THE HORSES LED BRIGHAM BUT ON THE SECOND MILE HE BEGAN PASSING THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND ON THE THIRD MILE HE WAS IN ADVANCE OF THEM ALL AND WAS SHOWING THEM ALL THE ROAD AT A LIVELY RATE ON THE FOURTH MILE HIS RIDER LET HIM OUT
3664-178355-0032 AND ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL THE HOME STATION IN WYANDOTTE A LONG WAY AHEAD OF HIS FASTEST COMPETITOR EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AS WELL AS DISGUSTED THAT SUCH A HOMELY CRITTER SHOULD BE THE WINNER BRIGHAM OF COURSE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED A WIDE REPUTATION
3664-178355-0033 AND HIS NAME AND EXPLOITS HAD OFTEN APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND WHEN IT WAS LEARNED THAT THIS CRITTER WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE IDENTICAL BUFFALO HUNTING BRIGHAM NEARLY THE WHOLE CROWD ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF HIM BEFORE AND HAD THEY KNOWN HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE RULED HIM OUT
3664-178355-0034 I FINALLY LOST TRACK OF BRIGHAM AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM THREE YEARS AGO WHILE I WAS AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE I MET A MISTER WILCOX WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HE OWNED BRIGHAM
3664-178355-0035 ONLY A FEW MILES OUT OF TOWN THE NEXT DAY I RODE OUT WITH MISTER WILCOX AND TOOK A LOOK AT THE GALLANT OLD HORSE HE WAS COMFORTABLY CARED FOR IN MISTER WILCOX'S STABLE AND LOOKED THE SAME CLEVER PONY THAT HE ALWAYS WAS IT SEEMED AS IF HE ALMOST REMEMBERED ME
3664-178355-0036 AND WHENEVER I AGAIN VISIT MEMPHIS I SHALL SURELY GO AND SEE BRIGHAM IF HE IS STILL ALIVE BUT TO RETURN TO THE THREAD OF MY NARRATIVE FROM WHICH I HAVE WANDERED
3947-13262-0000 HE HAD COME SUDDENLY UPON HER AS HE TURNED INTO THE AVENUE AND HIS HEART HAD LEAPED UP AT THE SIGHT OF HER HE WALKED ALONG BY HER NOW REJOICING AFTER ALL IN A LITTLE MOMENT OF THIS EARTHLY LOVE HE COULD NOT DRIVE OUT OF HIS LIFE I HAVE JUST BEEN OVER TO SEE VIRGINIA
3947-13262-0001 SAID RACHEL SHE TELLS ME THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NEARLY COMPLETED FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE RECTANGLE PROPERTY YES IT HAS BEEN A TEDIOUS CASE IN THE COURTS DID VIRGINIA SHOW YOU ALL THE PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR BUILDING
3947-13262-0002 WE LOOKED OVER A GOOD MANY IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME WHERE VIRGINIA HAS MANAGED TO GET ALL HER IDEAS ABOUT THIS WORK VIRGINIA KNOWS MORE NOW ABOUT ARNOLD TOYNBEE AND EAST END LONDON AND INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH WORK IN AMERICA
3947-13262-0003 THAN A GOOD MANY PROFESSIONAL SLUM WORKERS SHE HAS BEEN SPENDING NEARLY ALL SUMMER IN GETTING INFORMATION ROLLIN WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MORE AT EASE AS THEY TALKED OVER THIS COMING WORK OF HUMANITY IT WAS SAFE COMMON GROUND
3947-13262-0004 WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL SUMMER I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF YOU RACHEL SUDDENLY ASKED AND THEN HER FACE WARMED WITH ITS QUICK FLUSH OF TROPICAL COLOR AS IF SHE MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED TOO MUCH INTEREST IN ROLLIN OR TOO MUCH REGRET AT NOT SEEING HIM OFTENER
3947-13262-0005 I HAVE BEEN BUSY REPLIED ROLLIN BRIEFLY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT PERSISTED RACHEL YOU SAY SO LITTLE
3947-13262-0006 SHE PUT THE QUESTION VERY FRANKLY TURNING TOWARD ROLLIN IN REAL EARNEST YES CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A GRACEFUL SMILE I AM NOT SO CERTAIN THAT I CAN TELL YOU MUCH
3947-13262-0007 I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO REACH THE MEN I ONCE KNEW AND WIN THEM INTO MORE USEFUL LIVES HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS IF HE WERE ALMOST AFRAID TO GO ON RACHEL DID NOT VENTURE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING
3947-13262-0008 I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SAME COMPANY TO WHICH YOU AND VIRGINIA BELONG CONTINUED ROLLIN BEGINNING AGAIN I HAVE MADE THE PLEDGE TO DO AS I BELIEVE JESUS WOULD DO
3947-13262-0009 AND IT IS IN TRYING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING MY WORK THAT IS WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND VIRGINIA TOLD ME ABOUT THE OTHER IT SEEMS WONDERFUL TO THINK THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO KEEP THAT PLEDGE WITH US BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THE CLUB MEN
3947-13262-0010 YOU HAVE ASKED ME A DIRECT QUESTION AND I SHALL HAVE TO ANSWER IT NOW REPLIED ROLLIN SMILING AGAIN YOU SEE I ASKED MYSELF AFTER THAT NIGHT AT THE TENT YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE HURRIEDLY AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE
3947-13262-0011 WHAT PURPOSE I COULD NOW HAVE IN MY LIFE TO REDEEM IT TO SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE I WAS DRIVEN TO A PLACE WHERE I KNEW I MUST TAKE UP THE CROSS
3947-13262-0012 DID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TO
3947-13262-0013 THE CHURCHES LOOK AFTER THE POOR MISERABLE CREATURES LIKE THOSE IN THE RECTANGLE THEY MAKE SOME EFFORT TO REACH THE WORKING MAN THEY HAVE A LARGE CONSTITUENCY AMONG THE AVERAGE SALARY EARNING PEOPLE THEY SEND MONEY AND MISSIONARIES TO THE FOREIGN HEATHEN
3947-13262-0014 BUT THE FASHIONABLE DISSIPATED YOUNG MEN AROUND TOWN THE CLUB MEN ARE LEFT OUT OF ALL PLANS FOR REACHING AND CHRISTIANIZING AND YET NO CLASS OF PEOPLE NEED IT MORE I SAID TO MYSELF I KNOW THESE MEN THEIR GOOD AND THEIR BAD QUALITIES I HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM
3947-13262-0015 I AM NOT FITTED TO REACH THE RECTANGLE PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT I THINK I COULD POSSIBLY REACH SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE MONEY AND TIME TO SPEND SO THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO
3947-13262-0016 WHEN I ASKED AS YOU DID WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS MY ANSWER
3947-13262-0017 ROLLIN'S VOICE WAS SO LOW ON THIS LAST SENTENCE THAT RACHEL HAD DIFFICULTY IN HEARING HIM ABOVE THE NOISE AROUND THEM BUT SHE KNEW WHAT HE HAD SAID SHE WANTED TO ASK WHAT HIS METHODS WERE BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO ASK HIM
3947-13262-0018 HER INTEREST IN HIS PLAN WAS LARGER THAN MERE CURIOSITY ROLLIN PAGE WAS SO DIFFERENT NOW FROM THE FASHIONABLE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF HIM AND TALKING WITH HIM AS IF HE WERE AN ENTIRELY NEW ACQUAINTANCE
3947-13262-0019 THEY HAD TURNED OFF THE AVENUE AND WERE GOING UP THE STREET TO RACHEL'S HOME IT WAS THE SAME STREET WHERE ROLLIN HAD ASKED RACHEL WHY SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM THEY WERE BOTH STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHYNESS AS THEY WENT ON
3947-13262-0020 RACHEL HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT DAY AND ROLLIN COULD NOT SHE FINALLY BROKE A LONG SILENCE BY ASKING WHAT SHE HAD NOT FOUND WORDS FOR BEFORE
3947-13262-0021 IN YOUR WORK WITH THE CLUB MEN WITH YOUR OLD ACQUAINTANCES WHAT SORT OF RECEPTION DO THEY GIVE YOU HOW DO YOU APPROACH THEM WHAT DO THEY SAY ROLLIN WAS RELIEVED WHEN RACHEL SPOKE HE ANSWERED QUICKLY OH IT DEPENDS ON THE MAN
3947-13262-0022 A GOOD MANY OF THEM THINK I AM A CRANK I HAVE KEPT MY MEMBERSHIP UP AND AM IN GOOD STANDING IN THAT WAY I TRY TO BE WISE AND NOT PROVOKE ANY UNNECESSARY CRITICISM BUT YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED TO KNOW HOW MANY OF THE MEN HAVE RESPONDED TO MY APPEAL
3947-13262-0023 I COULD HARDLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT ONLY A FEW NIGHTS AGO A DOZEN MEN BECAME HONESTLY AND EARNESTLY ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION OVER RELIGIOUS MATTERS I HAVE HAD THE GREAT JOY OF SEEING SOME OF THE MEN GIVE UP BAD HABITS AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE
3947-13262-0024 WHAT WOULD JESUS DO I KEEP ASKING IT THE ANSWER COMES SLOWLY FOR I AM FEELING MY WAY SLOWLY ONE THING I HAVE FOUND OUT THE MEN ARE NOT FIGHTING SHY OF ME I THINK THAT IS A GOOD SIGN
3947-13262-0025 ANOTHER THING I HAVE ACTUALLY INTERESTED SOME OF THEM IN THE RECTANGLE WORK AND WHEN IT IS STARTED UP THEY WILL GIVE SOMETHING TO HELP MAKE IT MORE POWERFUL AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS FROM GOING TO THE BAD IN GAMBLING
3947-13262-0026 ROLLIN SPOKE WITH ENTHUSIASM HIS FACE WAS TRANSFORMED BY HIS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD NOW BECOME A PART OF HIS REAL LIFE RACHEL AGAIN NOTED THE STRONG MANLY TONE OF HIS SPEECH
3947-13262-0027 WITH IT ALL SHE KNEW THERE WAS A DEEP UNDERLYING SERIOUSNESS WHICH FELT THE BURDEN OF THE CROSS EVEN WHILE CARRYING IT WITH JOY THE NEXT TIME SHE SPOKE IT WAS WITH A SWIFT FEELING OF JUSTICE DUE TO ROLLIN AND HIS NEW LIFE
3947-13262-0028 DO YOU REMEMBER I REPROACHED YOU ONCE FOR NOT HAVING ANY PURPOSE WORTH LIVING FOR SHE ASKED WHILE HER BEAUTIFUL FACE SEEMED TO ROLLIN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER WHEN HE HAD WON SUFFICIENT SELF CONTROL TO LOOK UP I WANT TO SAY
3947-13262-0029 I FEEL THE NEED OF SAYING IN JUSTICE TO YOU NOW THAT I HONOR YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND YOUR OBEDIENCE TO THE PROMISE YOU HAVE MADE AS YOU INTERPRET THE PROMISE THE LIFE YOU ARE LIVING IS A NOBLE ONE ROLLIN TREMBLED HIS AGITATION WAS GREATER THAN HE COULD CONTROL
3947-13262-0030 RACHEL COULD NOT HELP SEEING IT THEY WALKED ALONG IN SILENCE AT LAST ROLLIN SAID I THANK YOU IT HAS BEEN WORTH MORE TO ME THAN I CAN TELL YOU TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT HE LOOKED INTO HER FACE FOR ONE MOMENT
3947-13262-0031 SHE READ HIS LOVE FOR HER IN THAT LOOK BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK WHEN THEY SEPARATED RACHEL WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SITTING DOWN IN HER ROOM SHE PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND SAID TO HERSELF
3947-13262-0032 I AM BEGINNING TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LOVED BY A NOBLE MAN I SHALL LOVE ROLLIN PAGE AFTER ALL WHAT AM I SAYING RACHEL WINSLOW HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN SHE ROSE AND WALKED BACK AND FORTH SHE WAS DEEPLY MOVED
3947-13262-0033 NEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HER
3947-13262-0034 IT WAS INDEED A PART OF IT FOR IF SHE WAS BEGINNING TO LOVE ROLLIN PAGE IT WAS THE CHRISTIAN MAN SHE HAD BEGUN TO LOVE THE OTHER NEVER WOULD HAVE MOVED HER TO THIS GREAT CHANGE
3947-13262-0035 AND ROLLIN AS HE WENT BACK TREASURED A HOPE THAT HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HIM SINCE RACHEL HAD SAID NO THAT DAY
3947-13262-0036 IN THAT HOPE HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK AS THE DAYS SPED ON AND AT NO TIME WAS HE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING AND SAVING HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCES THAN IN THE TIME THAT FOLLOWED THAT CHANCE MEETING WITH RACHEL WINSLOW
3947-13262-0037 THE SUMMER HAD GONE AND RAYMOND WAS ONCE MORE FACING THE RIGOR OF HER WINTER SEASON VIRGINIA HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A PART OF HER PLAN FOR CAPTURING THE RECTANGLE AS SHE CALLED IT
3947-13262-0038 BUT THE BUILDING OF HOUSES IN THE FIELD THE TRANSFORMING OF ITS BLEAK BARE ASPECT INTO AN ATTRACTIVE PARK ALL OF WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN HER PLAN WAS A WORK TOO LARGE TO BE COMPLETED THAT FALL AFTER SHE HAD SECURED THE PROPERTY
3947-13262-0039 BUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULD
3947-13262-0040 OUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH WONDERS FOR HUMANITY IN A SHORT TIME AND HENRY MAXWELL GOING OVER TO THE SCENE OF THE NEW WORK ONE DAY AFTER A NOON HOUR WITH THE SHOP MEN WAS AMAZED TO SEE HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE OUTWARDLY
3947-13262-0041 YET HE WALKED HOME THOUGHTFULLY AND ON HIS WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUAL PROBLEM THRUST UPON HIS NOTICE BY THE SALOON HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE RECTANGLE AFTER ALL
3947-13262-0042 EVEN COUNTING VIRGINIA'S AND RACHEL'S WORK AND MISTER GRAY'S WHERE HAD IT ACTUALLY COUNTED IN ANY VISIBLE QUANTITY
3947-13262-0043 OF COURSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THE REDEMPTIVE WORK BEGUN AND CARRIED ON BY THE HOLY SPIRIT IN HIS WONDERFUL DISPLAYS OF POWER IN THE FIRST CHURCH AND IN THE TENT MEETINGS HAD HAD ITS EFFECT UPON THE LIFE OF RAYMOND
3947-13262-0044 BUT AS HE WALKED PAST SALOON AFTER SALOON AND NOTED THE CROWDS GOING IN AND COMING OUT OF THEM AS HE SAW THE WRETCHED DENS AS MANY AS EVER APPARENTLY
3947-13262-0045 HE SICKENED AT THE SIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF ASKING HOW MUCH CLEANSING COULD A MILLION DOLLARS POURED INTO THIS CESSPOOL ACCOMPLISH
3947-13262-0046 WAS NOT THE LIVING SOURCE OF NEARLY ALL THE HUMAN MISERY THEY SOUGHT TO RELIEVE UNTOUCHED AS LONG AS THE SALOONS DID THEIR DEADLY BUT LEGITIMATE WORK
3947-13262-0047 WAS IT NOT A PRACTICAL WASTE OF BEAUTIFUL LIVES FOR THESE YOUNG WOMEN TO THROW THEMSELVES INTO THIS EARTHLY HELL WHEN FOR EVERY SOUL RESCUED BY THEIR SACRIFICE THE SALOON MADE TWO MORE THAT NEEDED RESCUE HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE QUESTION
3947-13262-0048 IT WAS THE SAME THAT VIRGINIA HAD PUT TO RACHEL IN HER STATEMENT THAT IN HER OPINION NOTHING REALLY PERMANENT WOULD EVER BE DONE UNTIL THE SALOON WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE RECTANGLE
3947-13262-0049 HENRY MAXWELL WENT BACK TO HIS PARISH WORK THAT AFTERNOON WITH ADDED CONVICTIONS ON THE LICENSE BUSINESS BUT IF THE SALOON WAS A FACTOR IN THE PROBLEM OF THE LIFE OF RAYMOND NO LESS WAS THE FIRST CHURCH AND ITS LITTLE COMPANY OF DISCIPLES WHO HAD PLEDGED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO
3947-13262-0050 HENRY MAXWELL STANDING AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE MOVEMENT WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE OF ITS POWER AS SOME ONE FROM THE OUTSIDE MIGHT HAVE DONE BUT RAYMOND ITSELF FELT THE TOUCH IN VERY MANY WAYS NOT KNOWING ALL THE REASONS FOR THE CHANGE
3947-13262-0051 THE WINTER WAS GONE AND THE YEAR WAS ENDED THE YEAR WHICH HENRY MAXWELL HAD FIXED AS THE TIME DURING WHICH THE PLEDGE SHOULD BE KEPT TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO SUNDAY THE ANNIVERSARY OF THAT ONE A YEAR AGO WAS IN MANY WAYS THE MOST REMARKABLE DAY THAT THE FIRST CHURCH EVER KNEW
460-172359-0000 IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
460-172359-0001 THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
460-172359-0002 AS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE
460-172359-0003 WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
460-172359-0004 TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0005 EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
460-172359-0006 IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
460-172359-0007 I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
460-172359-0008 WITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESS
460-172359-0009 AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0010 THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
460-172359-0011 AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERN
460-172359-0012 IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
460-172359-0013 ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
460-172359-0014 THEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTER
460-172359-0015 AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
460-172359-0016 AND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT IT
460-172359-0017 THE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBER
460-172359-0018 AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
460-172359-0019 YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
460-172359-0020 WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
460-172359-0021 THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
460-172359-0022 AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
460-172359-0023 THERE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN THAT JEFF WOULD SIZE UP SIDEWAYS AS HE STROPPED THE RAZOR AND IN WHOSE EAR HE WOULD WHISPER I SEE WHERE SAINT LOUIS HAS TOOK FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES OFF CHICAGO AND SO HOLD HIM FASCINATED TO THE END IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD SAY TO MISTER SMITH
460-172359-0024 I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
460-172359-0025 THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
460-172359-0026 EXACTLY THE KIND OF A HEAD A MAN NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE A HAUL OR A CLEAN UP IT WAS EVIDENTLY SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE HEAD AND AS FAR AS ONE COULD JUDGE JEFF'S OWN WAS THE VERY TYPE REQUIRED I DON'T KNOW JUST AT WHAT TIME OR HOW JEFFERSON FIRST BEGAN HIS SPECULATIVE ENTERPRISES
460-172359-0027 IT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAP
460-172359-0028 I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
460-172359-0029 THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
460-172359-0030 I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
460-172359-0031 AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
460-172359-0032 AND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON IT
460-172359-0033 SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
460-172359-0034 WITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORE
460-172359-0035 CAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIME
460-172359-0036 THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
460-172359-0037 JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLES
460-172359-0038 THEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSH
460-172359-0039 BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
460-172359-0040 AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
460-172359-0041 AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
460-172359-0042 BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
460-172359-0043 I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
460-172359-0044 BUT IF A FELLER KNOWS THE COUNTRY AND KEEPS HIS HEAD LEVEL HE CAN'T LOSE JEFFERSON HAD LOOKED AT SO MANY PROSPECTUSES AND SO MANY PICTURES OF MINES AND PINE TREES AND SMELTERS THAT I THINK HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT HE'D NEVER BEEN IN THE COUNTRY ANYWAY WHAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILES
460-172359-0045 TO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWEL
460-172359-0046 THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
460-172359-0047 THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
460-172359-0048 UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
460-172359-0049 IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
460-172359-0050 I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
460-172359-0051 AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
460-172359-0052 A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
460-172359-0053 AND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALK
460-172359-0054 AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
460-172359-0055 EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
460-172359-0056 AND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPS
460-172359-0057 AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIP
460-172359-0058 A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
460-172359-0059 WITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKE
460-172359-0060 THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
460-172359-0061 ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
460-172359-0062 THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
460-172359-0063 HE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUS
460-172359-0064 AND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERT
460-172359-0065 SO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNING
460-172359-0066 AND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THIS
460-172359-0067 JEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOW
460-172359-0068 FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
460-172359-0069 AND THAT TOUCHES YOU NO THEY ASKED NO GUARANTEE JUST SEND THE MONEY WHETHER BY EXPRESS ORDER OR BY BANK DRAFT OR CHEQUE THEY LEFT THAT ENTIRELY TO ONESELF AS A MATTER BETWEEN CUBAN GENTLEMEN AND THEY WERE QUITE FRANK ABOUT THEIR ENTERPRISE
460-172359-0070 BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
460-172359-0071 THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
460-172359-0072 I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
460-172359-0073 A FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBA
460-172359-0074 ALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBA
460-172359-0075 AND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
460-172359-0076 AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
460-172359-0077 LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
460-172359-0078 I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW IT
460-172359-0079 IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
460-172359-0080 HE WOULD SAY AND ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF SHAVING AND ALMOST WHISPER DID YOU EVER SEE THIS ROCKEFELLER IT WAS ONLY BY A SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO JEFFERSON'S SPECULATION THAT NO ONE IN MARIPOSA EVER KNEW OR WILL EVER KNOW NOW
460-172359-0081 YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
460-172359-0082 THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
460-172359-0083 AND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE TABLE WAS THE WOMAN DOING NEEDLEWORK AND MYRA WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS THERE TOO WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE READING MARIE CORELLI
460-172359-0084 JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
460-172359-0085 I MAY SAY IN PARENTHESES THAT IT WAS A FAVOURITE METHOD IN MARIPOSA IF YOU WANTED TO GET AT THE REAL WORTH OF A MAN TO IMAGINE HIM CLEAN SOLD UP PUT UP FOR AUCTION AS IT WERE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO TEST HIM AND NOW LOOK AT EM JEFF WENT ON
460-172359-0086 THEY GIVE IT AWAY AND WHO DO THEY GIVE IT TO WHY TO THOSE AS DON'T WANT IT EVERY TIME THEY GIVE IT TO THESE PROFESSORS AND TO THIS RESEARCH AND THAT AND DO THE POOR GET ANY OF IT NOT A CENT AND NEVER WILL I TELL YOU BOYS CONTINUED JEFF
460-172359-0087 THERE WERE NO BOYS PRESENT BUT IN MARIPOSA ALL REALLY IMPORTANT SPEECHES ARE ADDRESSED TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE OF BOYS I TELL YOU IF I WAS TO MAKE A MILLION OUT OF THIS CUBEY I'D GIVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE POOR YES SIR DIVIDE IT UP INTO A HUNDRED LOTS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HADN'T NOTHING
460-172359-0088 SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
460-172359-0089 HE ASKED ME FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HOW MANY BLIND PEOPLE IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL ONE OF THESE BLIND HOMES AND HOW A FELLER COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM
460-172359-0090 A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
460-172359-0091 BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
460-172359-0092 ELSE HOW WAS IT THAT HENRY MULLINS MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SELLING A DRAFT FOR FORTY THOUSAND ON NEW YORK AND WHY WAS IT THAT MISTER SMITH WOULDN'T PAY BILLY THE DESK CLERK HIS BACK WAGES WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT IT INTO CUBA OH YES SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE SEEN IT
460-172359-0093 AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
460-172359-0094 YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
460-172359-0095 THAT WAS JEFF'S MONEY PART OF IT MULLINS GOT THE TELEGRAM FROM A BROKER OR SOMEONE AND HE SHOWED IT TO JEFF JUST AS HE WAS GOING UP THE STREET WITH AN ESTATE AGENT TO LOOK AT A BIG EMPTY LOT ON THE HILL BEHIND THE TOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR THESE INCURABLES
460-172359-0096 AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
460-172359-0097 AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
460-172359-0098 JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
460-172359-0099 THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD
4640-19188-0000 CHAPTER FOUR MINUS FIVE PLUS ONE
4640-19188-0001 STILL GREAT AS WAS THIS OMNIPOTENCE A MURMUR AROSE
4640-19188-0002 HE RESUMED HAUGHTILY LET THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF NOT NUMBERING MORE THAN THIRTY SAY SO THE MURMURS REDOUBLED
4640-19188-0003 YOU WOULD FALL IN WITH SOME GRAND GUARD OF THE LINE OR THE SUBURBS

4640-19188-0007 DIE IF YOU WILL BUT DON'T MAKE OTHERS DIE SUICIDES LIKE THAT WHICH IS ON THE BRINK OF ACCOMPLISHMENT HERE ARE SUBLIME BUT SUICIDE IS NARROW AND DOES NOT ADMIT OF EXTENSION
4640-19188-0008 AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES YOUR NEIGHBORS SUICIDE IS MURDER THINK OF THE LITTLE BLOND HEADS THINK OF THE WHITE LOCKS
4640-19188-0009 ON THE FIFTH FLOOR AND ON THE PANE THE QUIVERING SHADOW OF THE HEAD OF AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD THE AIR OF HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT IN WATCHING PERHAPS SHE IS THE MOTHER OF SOME ONE OF YOU
4640-19188-0010 LET HIM FEEL AT EASE THE TASK HERE WILL BE PERFORMED ALL THE SAME WHEN ONE SUPPORTS ONE'S RELATIVES BY ONE'S TOIL ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO SACRIFICE ONE'S SELF
4640-19188-0011 THAT IS DESERTING ONE'S FAMILY AND THOSE WHO HAVE DAUGHTERS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF YOU GET YOURSELVES KILLED YOU ARE DEAD THAT IS WELL AND TOMORROW YOUNG GIRLS WITHOUT BREAD THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING
4640-19188-0012 WHO SING AND PRATTLE WHO ARE LIKE A LIVING PERFUME WHO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF ANGELS IN HEAVEN BY THE PURITY OF VIRGINS ON EARTH
4640-19188-0013 THOSE ADORABLE AND HONEST CREATURES WHO ARE YOUR BLESSINGS AND YOUR PRIDE AH GOOD GOD THEY WILL SUFFER HUNGER WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO YOU
4640-19188-0014 THINK OF THE SHOPS PAST WHICH WOMEN GO AND COME WITH NECKS ALL BARE AND THROUGH THE MIRE THESE WOMEN TOO WERE PURE ONCE THINK OF YOUR SISTERS THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE THEM
4640-19188-0015 YOU ARE NO LONGER ON HAND THAT IS WELL YOU HAVE WISHED TO RELEASE THE PEOPLE FROM ROYALTY AND YOU DELIVER OVER YOUR DAUGHTERS TO THE POLICE FRIENDS HAVE A CARE HAVE MERCY
4640-19188-0016 WE PREVENT THEIR OCCUPYING THEMSELVES WITH POLITICS WILL YOU PREVENT THEM FROM GOING TO THE DEAD HOUSE THIS EVENING AND RECOGNIZING YOUR BODIES LET US SEE THOSE WHO HAVE FAMILIES MUST BE TRACTABLE
4640-19188-0017 AND SHAKE HANDS WITH US AND TAKE THEMSELVES OFF AND LEAVE US HERE ALONE TO ATTEND TO THIS AFFAIR I KNOW WELL THAT COURAGE IS REQUIRED TO LEAVE THAT IT IS HARD BUT THE HARDER IT IS THE MORE MERITORIOUS
4640-19188-0018 YOU SAY I HAVE A GUN I AM AT THE BARRICADE SO MUCH THE WORSE I SHALL REMAIN THERE SO MUCH THE WORSE IS EASILY SAID MY FRIENDS THERE IS A MORROW YOU WILL NOT BE HERE TO MORROW
4640-19188-0019 BUT YOUR FAMILIES WILL AND WHAT SUFFERINGS SEE HERE IS A PRETTY HEALTHY CHILD WITH CHEEKS LIKE AN APPLE WHO BABBLES PRATTLES CHATTERS WHO LAUGHS WHO SMELLS SWEET BENEATH YOUR KISS
4640-19188-0020 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF HIM WHEN HE IS ABANDONED I HAVE SEEN ONE A VERY SMALL CREATURE NO TALLER THAN THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD POOR PEOPLE HAD TAKEN HIM IN OUT OF CHARITY
4640-19188-0021 AND WHOSE PIPE YOU KNOW WAS OF MASTIC AND YELLOW CLAY HIS BREATHING WAS HOARSE HIS FACE LIVID HIS LIMBS FLACCID HIS BELLY PROMINENT HE SAID NOTHING IF YOU SPOKE TO HIM HE DID NOT ANSWER
4640-19188-0022 HE IS DEAD HE WAS TAKEN TO THE NECKER HOSPITAL WHERE I SAW HIM I WAS HOUSE SURGEON IN THAT HOSPITAL
4640-19188-0023 THAT POOR BRAT I REMEMBER AND I SEEM TO SEE HIM NOW WHEN HE LAY NUDE ON THE DISSECTING TABLE HOW HIS RIBS STOOD OUT ON HIS SKIN LIKE THE GRAVES BENEATH THE GRASS IN A CEMETERY
4640-19188-0024 STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MORTALITY AMONG ABANDONED CHILDREN IS FIFTY FIVE PER CENT I REPEAT IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN IT CONCERNS MOTHERS IT CONCERNS YOUNG GIRLS IT CONCERNS LITTLE CHILDREN
4640-19188-0025 BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS WORLD THERE ARE OTHER BEINGS OF WHOM YOU MUST THINK YOU MUST NOT BE EGOISTS ALL DROPPED THEIR HEADS WITH A GLOOMY AIR
4640-19188-0026 STRANGE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART AT ITS MOST SUBLIME MOMENTS COMBEFERRE WHO SPOKE THUS WAS NOT AN ORPHAN HE RECALLED THE MOTHERS OF OTHER MEN AND FORGOT HIS OWN
4640-19188-0027 HE WAS ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF KILLED HE WAS AN EGOIST MARIUS FASTING FEVERED HAVING EMERGED IN SUCCESSION FROM ALL HOPE AND HAVING BEEN STRANDED IN GRIEF THE MOST SOMBRE OF SHIPWRECKS
4640-19188-0028 AND CLASSIFIED BY SCIENCE AND WHICH IS TO SUFFERING WHAT VOLUPTUOUSNESS IS TO PLEASURE DESPAIR ALSO HAS ITS ECSTASY MARIUS HAD REACHED THIS POINT
4640-19188-0029 HE BEHELD MEN GOING AND COMING AS THROUGH A FLAME HE HEARD VOICES SPEAKING AS AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS BUT THIS MOVED HIM THERE WAS IN THIS SCENE A POINT WHICH PIERCED AND ROUSED EVEN HIM
4640-19188-0030 HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA NOW TO DIE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO BE TURNED ASIDE FROM IT BUT HE REFLECTED IN HIS GLOOMY SOMNAMBULISM THAT WHILE DESTROYING HIMSELF
4640-19188-0031 IT IS YOUR DUTY RATHER RETORTED THE MAN YOU HAVE TWO SISTERS WHOM YOU MAINTAIN AND AN UNPRECEDENTED CONTROVERSY BROKE FORTH
4640-19188-0032 THIS IS THE REPUBLIC AND UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE REIGNS DO YOU YOURSELVES DESIGNATE THOSE WHO ARE TO GO THEY OBEYED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES FIVE WERE UNANIMOUSLY SELECTED
4640-19188-0033 AND STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM EXCLAIMED MARIUS THERE WERE ONLY FOUR UNIFORMS WELL BEGAN THE FIVE ONE MUST STAY BEHIND
4640-19188-0034 AND THEN A STRUGGLE AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD REMAIN AND WHO SHOULD FIND REASONS FOR THE OTHERS NOT REMAINING THE GENEROUS QUARREL BEGAN AFRESH YOU HAVE A WIFE WHO LOVES YOU
4640-19188-0035 DO YOU DESIGNATE WHO IS TO REMAIN YES SAID THE FIVE CHOOSE WE WILL OBEY YOU MARIUS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANOTHER EMOTION
4640-19188-0036 WHICH ONE BEHOLDS IN THE DEPTHS OF HISTORY HOVERING OVER THERMOPYLAE
4640-19188-0037 AND MARIUS STUPIDLY COUNTED THEM THERE WERE STILL FIVE OF THEM THEN HIS GLANCE DROPPED TO THE FOUR UNIFORMS AT THAT MOMENT A FIFTH UNIFORM FELL AS IF FROM HEAVEN UPON THE OTHER FOUR
4640-19188-0038 THE FIFTH MAN WAS SAVED
4640-19188-0039 THANKS TO HIS DRESS OF A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE SENTINEL STATIONED BY THE INSURGENTS IN THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD NO OCCASION TO GIVE THE ALARM FOR A SINGLE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
4640-19188-0040 AND HE HAD SILENTLY REMOVED HIS COAT AND FLUNG IT ON THE PILE WITH THE REST THE EMOTION AROUSED WAS INDESCRIBABLE
4680-16042-0000 IT WAS THE REFLECTION OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS BURNING IN THE CORINTHE BARRICADE MARIUS DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THAT RED LIGHT
4680-16042-0001 HAD PRESERVED WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD AT THE CORNER OF THE LAST HOUSE ON HIS LEFT HE THRUST HIS HEAD FORWARD AND LOOKED INTO THE FRAGMENT OF THE RUE MONDETOUR
4680-16042-0002 WHICH CAST A BROAD CURTAIN OF SHADOW IN WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF ENGULFED HE PERCEIVED SOME LIGHT ON THE PAVEMENT A BIT OF THE WINE SHOP AND BEYOND A FLICKERING LAMP WITHIN A SORT OF SHAPELESS WALL AND MEN CROUCHING DOWN WITH GUNS ON THEIR KNEES
4680-16042-0003 ALL THIS WAS TEN FATHOMS DISTANT FROM HIM IT WAS THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THE HOUSES WHICH BORDERED THE LANE ON THE RIGHT CONCEALED THE REST OF THE WINE SHOP THE LARGE BARRICADE AND THE FLAG FROM HIM
4680-16042-0004 MARIUS HAD BUT A STEP MORE TO TAKE
4680-16042-0005 FOLDED HIS ARMS AND FELL TO THINKING ABOUT HIS FATHER HE THOUGHT OF THAT HEROIC COLONEL PONTMERCY WHO HAD BEEN SO PROUD A SOLDIER WHO HAD GUARDED THE FRONTIER OF FRANCE UNDER THE REPUBLIC
4680-16042-0006 HIS COCKADE BLACKENED WITH POWDER HIS BROW FURROWED WITH HIS HELMET IN BARRACKS IN CAMP IN THE BIVOUAC
4680-16042-0007 AT THE EXPIRATION OF TWENTY YEARS HAD RETURNED FROM THE GREAT WARS WITH A SCARRED CHEEK A SMILING COUNTENANCE TRANQUIL ADMIRABLE PURE AS A CHILD HAVING DONE EVERYTHING FOR FRANCE AND NOTHING AGAINST HER
4680-16042-0008 TO OFFER HIS BREAST TO BAYONETS TO SHED HIS BLOOD TO SEEK THE ENEMY TO SEEK DEATH THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO WAGE WAR IN HIS TURN AND DESCEND TO THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND THAT THE FIELD OF BATTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS TO DESCEND WAS THE STREET
4680-16042-0009 HE THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER'S SWORD WHICH HIS GRANDFATHER HAD SOLD TO A SECOND HAND DEALER AND WHICH HE HAD SO MOURNFULLY REGRETTED HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THAT CHASTE AND VALIANT SWORD HAD DONE WELL TO ESCAPE FROM HIM
4680-16042-0010 AND TO DEPART IN WRATH INTO THE GLOOM THAT IF IT HAD THUS FLED IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS INTELLIGENT AND BECAUSE IT HAD FORESEEN THE FUTURE THAT IT HAD HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF THIS REBELLION THE WAR OF THE GUTTERS
4680-16042-0011 BLOWS GIVEN AND RECEIVED IN THE REAR IT WAS BECAUSE COMING FROM MARENGO AND FRIEDLAND IT DID NOT WISH TO GO TO THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE IT WAS BECAUSE AFTER WHAT IT HAD DONE WITH THE FATHER IT DID NOT WISH TO DO THIS FOR THE SON
4680-16042-0012 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IF THAT SWORD WERE THERE IF AFTER TAKING POSSESSION OF IT AT HIS FATHER'S PILLOW HE HAD DARED TO TAKE IT AND CARRY IT OFF FOR THIS COMBAT OF DARKNESS BETWEEN FRENCHMEN IN THE STREETS
4680-16042-0013 IT WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE SCORCHED HIS HANDS AND BURST OUT AFLAME BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE THE SWORD OF THE ANGEL
4680-16042-0014 WOUND THE SIDE OF HIS COUNTRY AND THEN HE FELL TO WEEPING BITTERLY THIS WAS HORRIBLE BUT WHAT WAS HE TO DO LIVE WITHOUT COSETTE HE COULD NOT SINCE SHE WAS GONE HE MUST NEEDS DIE
4680-16042-0015 HAD HE NOT GIVEN HER HIS WORD OF HONOR THAT HE WOULD DIE SHE HAD GONE KNOWING THAT THIS MEANT THAT IT PLEASED HER THAT MARIUS SHOULD DIE AND THEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE NO LONGER LOVED HIM
4680-16042-0016 SHOULD HE RETREAT AFTER GOING SO FAR SHOULD HE FLEE FROM DANGER AFTER HAVING APPROACHED IT SHOULD HE SLIP AWAY AFTER HAVING COME AND PEEPED INTO THE BARRICADE SLIP AWAY ALL IN A TREMBLE SAYING AFTER ALL I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AS IT IS
4680-16042-0017 WHO WERE A MERE HANDFUL AGAINST AN ARMY SHOULD HE BE UNTRUE AT ONCE TO HIS LOVE TO COUNTRY TO HIS WORD SHOULD HE GIVE TO HIS COWARDICE THE PRETEXT OF PATRIOTISM BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND IF THE PHANTOM OF HIS FATHER WAS THERE IN THE GLOOM
4680-16042-0018 ALL AT ONCE HE RAISED IT A SORT OF SPLENDID RECTIFICATION HAD JUST BEEN EFFECTED IN HIS MIND THERE IS A WIDENING OF THE SPHERE OF THOUGHT WHICH IS PECULIAR TO THE VICINITY OF THE GRAVE
4680-16042-0019 IT MAKES ONE SEE CLEARLY TO BE NEAR DEATH THE VISION OF THE ACTION INTO WHICH HE FELT THAT HE WAS PERHAPS ON THE POINT OF ENTERING APPEARED TO HIM NO MORE AS LAMENTABLE BUT AS SUPERB
4680-16042-0020 HE LEFT NONE OF THEM UNANSWERED LET US SEE WHY SHOULD HIS FATHER BE INDIGNANT ARE THERE NOT CASES WHERE INSURRECTION RISES TO THE DIGNITY OF DUTY
4680-16042-0021 CIVIL WAR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THERE A FOREIGN WAR IS NOT ALL WAR BETWEEN MEN WAR BETWEEN BROTHERS WAR IS QUALIFIED ONLY BY ITS OBJECT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FOREIGN OR CIVIL WAR
4680-16042-0022 THERE IS ONLY JUST AND UNJUST WAR UNTIL THAT DAY WHEN THE GRAND HUMAN AGREEMENT IS CONCLUDED WAR THAT AT LEAST WHICH IS THE EFFORT OF THE FUTURE WHICH IS HASTENING ON AGAINST THE PAST WHICH IS LAGGING IN THE REAR MAY BE NECESSARY
4680-16042-0023 WHETHER FOREIGN OR CIVIL IS INIQUITOUS IT IS CALLED CRIME OUTSIDE THE PALE OF THAT HOLY THING JUSTICE BY WHAT RIGHT DOES ONE FORM OF MAN DESPISE ANOTHER BY WHAT RIGHT SHOULD THE SWORD OF WASHINGTON
4680-16042-0024 THE ONE IS THE DEFENDER THE OTHER THE LIBERATOR SHALL WE BRAND EVERY APPEAL TO ARMS WITHIN A CITY'S LIMITS WITHOUT TAKING THE OBJECT INTO A CONSIDERATION THEN NOTE THE INFAMY OF BRUTUS MARCEL ARNOULD VON BLANKENHEIM COLIGNY HEDGEROW WAR
4680-16042-0025 WAR OF THE STREETS WHY NOT THAT WAS THE WAR OF AMBIORIX OF ARTEVELDE OF MARNIX OF PELAGIUS BUT AMBIORIX FOUGHT AGAINST ROME ARTEVELDE AGAINST FRANCE
4680-16042-0026 AN INVASION VIOLATES THE GEOGRAPHICAL FRONTIER DRIVING OUT THE TYRANT OR DRIVING OUT THE ENGLISH IN BOTH CASES REGAINING POSSESSION OF ONE'S OWN TERRITORY THERE COMES AN HOUR WHEN PROTESTATION NO LONGER SUFFICES
4680-16042-0027 THE TENTH OF AUGUST ELECTRIFIES THEM
4680-16042-0028 AFTER DIDEROT DANTON MULTITUDES HAVE A TENDENCY TO ACCEPT THE MASTER THEIR MASS BEARS WITNESS TO APATHY A CROWD IS EASILY LED AS A WHOLE TO OBEDIENCE MEN MUST BE STIRRED UP PUSHED ON
4680-16042-0029 TREATED ROUGHLY BY THE VERY BENEFIT OF THEIR DELIVERANCE THEIR EYES MUST BE WOUNDED BY THE TRUE LIGHT MUST BE HURLED AT THEM IN TERRIBLE HANDFULS
4680-16042-0030 OF WHOM ARE YOU SPEAKING DO YOU CALL LOUIS PHILIPPE THE TYRANT NO
4680-16042-0031 ARE WHAT HISTORY IS IN THE HABIT OF CALLING GOOD KINGS BUT PRINCIPLES ARE NOT TO BE PARCELLED OUT THE LOGIC OF THE TRUE IS RECTILINEAR THE PECULIARITY OF TRUTH IS THAT IT LACKS COMPLAISANCE NO CONCESSIONS THEN
4680-16042-0032 BOTH REPRESENT IN A CERTAIN MEASURE THE CONFISCATION OF RIGHT AND IN ORDER TO CLEAR AWAY UNIVERSAL INSURRECTION THEY MUST BE COMBATED IT MUST BE DONE FRANCE BEING ALWAYS THE ONE TO BEGIN
4680-16042-0033 WHEN THE MASTER FALLS IN FRANCE HE FALLS EVERYWHERE IN SHORT WHAT CAUSE IS MORE JUST AND CONSEQUENTLY WHAT WAR IS GREATER THAN THAT WHICH RE ESTABLISHES SOCIAL TRUTH
4680-16042-0034 RESTORES THE PEOPLE TO THE PEOPLE RESTORES SOVEREIGNTY TO MAN REPLACES THE PURPLE ON THE HEAD OF FRANCE RESTORES EQUITY AND REASON IN THEIR PLENITUDE SUPPRESSES EVERY GERM OF ANTAGONISM BY RESTORING EACH ONE TO HIMSELF
4680-16042-0035 ANNIHILATES THE OBSTACLE WHICH ROYALTY PRESENTS TO THE WHOLE IMMENSE UNIVERSAL CONCORD AND PLACES THE HUMAN RACE ONCE MORE ON A LEVEL WITH THE RIGHT THESE WARS BUILD UP PEACE
4680-16042-0036 THERE IS NO ONE WHO HAS NOT NOTICED IT IN HIS OWN CASE THE SOUL AND THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF ITS UNITY COMPLICATED WITH UBIQUITY HAS A STRANGE APTITUDE FOR REASONING ALMOST COLDLY IN THE MOST VIOLENT EXTREMITIES
4680-16042-0037 WITHOUT MOVING AND THERE WAS PERCEPTIBLE THAT QUASI SILENCE WHICH MARKS THE LAST STAGE OF EXPECTATION OVERHEAD AT THE SMALL WINDOW IN THE THIRD STORY MARIUS DESCRIED A SORT OF SPECTATOR WHO APPEARED TO HIM TO BE SINGULARLY ATTENTIVE
4680-16042-0038 THIS WAS THE PORTER WHO HAD BEEN KILLED BY LE CABUC BELOW BY THE LIGHTS OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS THRUST BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES THIS HEAD COULD BE VAGUELY DISTINGUISHED NOTHING COULD BE STRANGER IN THAT SOMBRE AND UNCERTAIN GLEAM
4680-16042-0039 ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE MAN WHO WAS DEAD WAS SURVEYING THOSE WHO WERE ABOUT TO DIE A LONG TRAIL OF BLOOD WHICH HAD FLOWED FROM THAT HEAD DESCENDED IN REDDISH THREADS FROM THE WINDOW TO THE HEIGHT OF THE FIRST FLOOR
5789-70653-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE INQUEST THE CORONER WHO FULLY REALIZED THAT FOR THAT ONE DAY OF HIS LIFE AS A PROVINCIAL SOLICITOR HE WAS LIVING IN THE GAZE OF THE WORLD HAD RESOLVED TO BE WORTHY OF THE FLEETING EMINENCE
5789-70653-0001 HE WAS A LARGE MAN OF JOVIAL TEMPER WITH A STRONG INTEREST IN THE DRAMATIC ASPECTS OF HIS WORK AND THE NEWS OF MANDERSON'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH WITHIN HIS JURISDICTION HAD MADE HIM THE HAPPIEST CORONER IN ENGLAND
5789-70653-0002 THE COURT WAS HELD IN A LONG UNFURNISHED ROOM LATELY BUILT ONTO THE HOTEL AND INTENDED TO SERVE AS A BALL ROOM OR CONCERT HALL A REGIMENT OF REPORTERS WAS ENTRENCHED IN THE FRONT SEATS
5789-70653-0003 AND THOSE WHO WERE TO BE CALLED ON TO GIVE EVIDENCE OCCUPIED CHAIRS TO ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE BEHIND WHICH THE CORONER SAT WHILE THE JURY IN DOUBLE ROW WITH PLASTERED HAIR AND A SPURIOUS EASE OF MANNER FLANKED HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5789-70653-0004 AN UNDISTINGUISHED PUBLIC FILLED THE REST OF THE SPACE AND LISTENED IN AN AWED SILENCE TO THE OPENING SOLEMNITIES THE NEWSPAPER MEN WELL USED TO THESE
5789-70653-0005 THE IDENTITY OF THE DEAD MAN WAS PROVED BY HIS WIFE THE FIRST WITNESS CALLED FROM WHOM THE CORONER AFTER SOME INQUIRY INTO THE HEALTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DECEASED
5789-70653-0006 PROCEEDED TO DRAW AN ACCOUNT OF THE LAST OCCASION ON WHICH SHE HAD SEEN HER HUSBAND ALIVE MISSUS MANDERSON WAS TAKEN THROUGH HER EVIDENCE BY THE CORONER
5789-70653-0007 WITH THE SYMPATHY WHICH EVERY MAN FELT FOR THAT DARK FIGURE OF GRIEF SHE LIFTED HER THICK VEIL BEFORE BEGINNING TO SPEAK AND THE EXTREME PALENESS AND UNBROKEN COMPOSURE OF THE LADY
5789-70653-0008 PRODUCED A SINGULAR IMPRESSION THIS WAS NOT AN IMPRESSION OF HARDNESS INTERESTING FEMININITY WAS THE FIRST THING TO BE FELT IN HER PRESENCE SHE WAS NOT EVEN ENIGMATIC
5789-70653-0009 BUT HER VOICE WAS LOW AND CLEAR TO THE END HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD COME UP TO HIS BEDROOM ABOUT HIS USUAL HOUR FOR RETIRING ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT
5789-70653-0010 HIS ROOM WAS REALLY A DRESSING ROOM ATTACHED TO HER OWN BEDROOM COMMUNICATING WITH IT BY A DOOR WHICH WAS USUALLY KEPT OPEN DURING THE NIGHT BOTH DRESSING ROOM AND BEDROOM WERE ENTERED BY OTHER DOORS GIVING ON THE PASSAGE
5789-70653-0011 AND LIKED TO SLEEP IN A SMALL ROOM SHE HAD NOT BEEN AWAKE WHEN HE CAME UP BUT HAD BEEN HALF AROUSED AS USUALLY HAPPENED WHEN THE LIGHT WAS SWITCHED ON IN HER HUSBAND'S ROOM SHE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
5789-70653-0012 SHE HAD NO CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID AS SHE HAD BEEN VERY DROWSY AT THE TIME BUT SHE HAD REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT FOR A MOONLIGHT RUN IN THE CAR
5789-70653-0013 AND WHAT TIME IT WAS SHE HAD ASKED WHAT THE TIME WAS
5789-70653-0014 HE DID EXPLAIN WHY I REMEMBER VERY WELL WHAT HE SAID BECAUSE SHE STOPPED WITH A LITTLE APPEARANCE OF CONFUSION BECAUSE THE CORONER INSISTED GENTLY
5789-70653-0015 HE SAID THAT MISTER MARLOWE COULD DO IT QUITE EASILY IF HE HAD NO ACCIDENT HE SAID THAT HE HAD STARTED IN THE CAR AND THEN WALKED BACK HOME A MILE OR SO AND FELT ALL THE BETTER FOR IT DID HE SAY ANY MORE
5789-70653-0016 AND YOU HEARD NOTHING IN THE NIGHT NO I NEVER WOKE UNTIL MY MAID BROUGHT MY TEA IN THE MORNING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK SHE CLOSED THE DOOR LEADING TO MY HUSBAND'S ROOM AS SHE ALWAYS DID
5789-70653-0017 AND I SUPPOSED HIM TO BE STILL THERE HE ALWAYS NEEDED A GREAT DEAL OF SLEEP HE SOMETIMES SLEPT UNTIL QUITE LATE IN THE MORNING I HAD BREAKFAST IN MY SITTING ROOM IT WAS ABOUT TEN WHEN I HEARD THAT MY HUSBAND'S BODY HAD BEEN FOUND
5789-70653-0018 THE WITNESS DROPPED HER HEAD AND SILENTLY WAITED FOR HER DISMISSAL BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE YET MISSUS MANDERSON THE CORONER'S VOICE WAS SYMPATHETIC BUT IT HAD A HINT OF FIRMNESS IN IT NOW
5789-70653-0019 THE QUESTION I AM GOING TO PUT TO YOU MUST IN THESE SAD CIRCUMSTANCES BE A PAINFUL ONE
5789-70653-0020 IS IT THE FACT THAT YOUR RELATIONS WITH YOUR LATE HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN FOR SOME TIME PAST RELATIONS OF MUTUAL AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE
5789-70653-0021 HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME HAD GIVEN ME GREAT ANXIETY AND SORROW HE HAD CHANGED TOWARDS ME HE HAD BECOME VERY RESERVED AND SEEMED MISTRUSTFUL I SAW MUCH LESS OF HIM THAN BEFORE
5789-70653-0022 HE SEEMED TO PREFER TO BE ALONE I CAN GIVE NO EXPLANATION AT ALL OF THE CHANGE I TRIED TO WORK AGAINST IT I DID ALL I COULD WITH JUSTICE TO MY OWN DIGNITY AS I THOUGHT
5789-70653-0023 SOMETHING WAS BETWEEN US I DID NOT KNOW WHAT AND HE NEVER TOLD ME MY OWN OBSTINATE PRIDE PREVENTED ME FROM ASKING WHAT IT WAS IN SO MANY WORDS
5789-70653-0024 I ONLY MADE A POINT OF BEING TO HIM EXACTLY AS I HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO FAR AS HE WOULD ALLOW ME I SUPPOSE I SHALL NEVER KNOW NOW WHAT IT WAS THE WITNESS WHOSE VOICE HAD TREMBLED IN SPITE OF HER SELF CONTROL
5789-70653-0025 THEN WAS THERE NEVER ANYTHING OF THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY CALL WORDS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND MA'AM NEVER
5789-70653-0026 THE WORD WAS COLORLESSLY SPOKEN BUT EVERYONE FELT THAT A CRASS MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF CONDUCT IN THE CASE OF A PERSON LIKE MISSUS MANDERSON HAD BEEN VISITED WITH SOME SEVERITY DID SHE KNOW THE CORONER ASKED
5789-70653-0027 OF ANY OTHER MATTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREYING UPON HER HUSBAND'S MIND RECENTLY MISSUS MANDERSON KNEW OF NONE WHATEVER THE CORONER INTIMATED THAT HER ORDEAL WAS AT AN END AND THE VEILED LADY MADE HER WAY TO THE DOOR
5789-70653-0028 THE GENERAL ATTENTION WHICH FOLLOWED HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS NOW EAGERLY DIRECTED UPON MARTIN WHOM THE CORONER HAD PROCEEDED TO CALL IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT TRENT APPEARED AT THE DOORWAY AND EDGED HIS WAY INTO THE GREAT ROOM
5789-70653-0029 BUT HE DID NOT LOOK AT MARTIN HE WAS OBSERVING THE WELL BALANCED FIGURE THAT CAME QUICKLY TOWARD HIM ALONG AN OPENING PATH IN THE CROWD AND HIS EYE WAS GLOOMY
5789-70653-0030 HE STARTED AS HE STOOD ASIDE FROM THE DOOR WITH A SLIGHT BOW TO HEAR MISSUS MANDERSON ADDRESS HIM BY NAME IN A LOW VOICE HE FOLLOWED HER A PACE OR TWO INTO THE HALL I WANTED TO ASK YOU
5789-70653-0031 SHE SAID IN A VOICE NOW WEAK AND ODDLY BROKEN IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR ARM A PART OF THE WAY TO THE HOUSE I COULD NOT SEE MY UNCLE NEAR THE DOOR AND I SUDDENLY FELT RATHER FAINT I SHALL BE BETTER IN THE AIR
5789-70653-0032 SHE COULD DRAG HIM FROM THE PLACE THEN AGAIN SHE LEANED HEAVILY UPON IT AND WITH THAT SUPPORT AND WITH BENT HEAD SHE WALKED SLOWLY FROM THE HOTEL AND ALONG THE OAK SHADED PATH TOWARD WHITE GABLES
5789-70653-0033 RUSHED THROUGH HIS BRAIN IN A ROUT BUT THE TOUCH OF HER UNNERVED HAND UPON HIS ARM NEVER FOR AN INSTANT LEFT HIS CONSCIOUSNESS FILLING HIM WITH AN EXALTATION THAT ENRAGED AND BEWILDERED HIM
