3664-178355-0010 TILL THEY WOULD FINALLY CIRCLE ROUND AND ROUND ON THIS MORNING THE BUFFALOES WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING
3664-178355-0013 THEY PROVED TO BE A HERD OF COWS AND CALVES WHICH BY THE WAY ARE QUICKER IN THEIR MOVEMENTS THAN THE BULLS WE CHARGED IN AMONG THEM AND I CONCLUDED MY RUN WITH A SCORE OF EIGHTEEN WHILE COMSTOCK KILLED FOURTEEN
3664-178355-0018 COMSTOCK HAVING KILLED FORTY SIX AS IT WAS NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON COMSTOCK AND HIS BACKERS GAVE UP THE IDEA THAT HE COULD BEAT ME AND THEREUPON THE REFEREES DECLARED ME THE WINNER OF THE MATCH
3664-178355-0019 THEY PREPARED TO DEPART HAVING DECLINED AN INVITATION TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE
3664-178355-0021 OWING TO THE FLEETNESS OF THE EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS RIDING THIS SAD EVENT OCCURRED AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ON OUR WAY BACK TO CAMP WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE CHOICE MEAT AND FINEST HEADS
3664-178355-0029 A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS MADE UP TO BE GIVEN TO THE HORSE THAT COULD FIRST REACH WYANDOTTE FOUR MILES DISTANT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AND BRIGHAM WAS ENTERED AS ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS FOR THE PURSE
3664-178355-0036 AND WHENEVER I AGAIN VISIT MEMPHIS I SHALL SURELY GO AND SEE BRIGHAM IF HE IS STILL ALIVE BUT TO RETURN TO THE THREAD OF MY NARRATIVE FROM WHICH I HAVE WANDERED
3947-13262-0005 I HAVE BEEN BUSY REPLIED ROLLIN BRIEFLY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT PERSISTED RACHEL YOU SAY SO LITTLE
3947-13262-0006 SHE PUT THE QUESTION VERY FRANKLY TURNING TOWARD ROLLIN IN REAL EARNEST YES CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A GRACEFUL SMILE I AM NOT SO CERTAIN THAT I CAN TELL YOU MUCH
3947-13262-0008 I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SAME COMPANY TO WHICH YOU AND VIRGINIA BELONG CONTINUED ROLLIN BEGINNING AGAIN I HAVE MADE THE PLEDGE TO DO AS I BELIEVE JESUS WOULD DO
3947-13262-0011 WHAT PURPOSE I COULD NOW HAVE IN MY LIFE TO REDEEM IT TO SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE I WAS DRIVEN TO A PLACE WHERE I KNEW I MUST TAKE UP THE CROSS
3947-13262-0012 DID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TO
3947-13262-0015 I AM NOT FITTED TO REACH THE RECTANGLE PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT I THINK I COULD POSSIBLY REACH SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE MONEY AND TIME TO SPEND SO THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO
3947-13262-0016 WHEN I ASKED AS YOU DID WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS MY ANSWER
3947-13262-0020 RACHEL HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT DAY AND ROLLIN COULD NOT SHE FINALLY BROKE A LONG SILENCE BY ASKING WHAT SHE HAD NOT FOUND WORDS FOR BEFORE
3947-13262-0026 ROLLIN SPOKE WITH ENTHUSIASM HIS FACE WAS TRANSFORMED BY HIS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD NOW BECOME A PART OF HIS REAL LIFE RACHEL AGAIN NOTED THE STRONG MANLY TONE OF HIS SPEECH
3947-13262-0031 SHE READ HIS LOVE FOR HER IN THAT LOOK BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK WHEN THEY SEPARATED RACHEL WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SITTING DOWN IN HER ROOM SHE PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND SAID TO HERSELF
3947-13262-0033 NEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HER
3947-13262-0034 IT WAS INDEED A PART OF IT FOR IF SHE WAS BEGINNING TO LOVE ROLLIN PAGE IT WAS THE CHRISTIAN MAN SHE HAD BEGUN TO LOVE THE OTHER NEVER WOULD HAVE MOVED HER TO THIS GREAT CHANGE
3947-13262-0035 AND ROLLIN AS HE WENT BACK TREASURED A HOPE THAT HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HIM SINCE RACHEL HAD SAID NO THAT DAY
3947-13262-0036 IN THAT HOPE HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK AS THE DAYS SPED ON AND AT NO TIME WAS HE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING AND SAVING HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCES THAN IN THE TIME THAT FOLLOWED THAT CHANCE MEETING WITH RACHEL WINSLOW
3947-13262-0037 THE SUMMER HAD GONE AND RAYMOND WAS ONCE MORE FACING THE RIGOR OF HER WINTER SEASON VIRGINIA HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A PART OF HER PLAN FOR CAPTURING THE RECTANGLE AS SHE CALLED IT
3947-13262-0039 BUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULD
3947-13262-0040 OUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH WONDERS FOR HUMANITY IN A SHORT TIME AND HENRY MAXWELL GOING OVER TO THE SCENE OF THE NEW WORK ONE DAY AFTER A NOON HOUR WITH THE SHOP MEN WAS AMAZED TO SEE HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE OUTWARDLY
3947-13262-0041 YET HE WALKED HOME THOUGHTFULLY AND ON HIS WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUAL PROBLEM THRUST UPON HIS NOTICE BY THE SALOON HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE RECTANGLE AFTER ALL
3947-13262-0042 EVEN COUNTING VIRGINIA'S AND RACHEL'S WORK AND MISTER GRAY'S WHERE HAD IT ACTUALLY COUNTED IN ANY VISIBLE QUANTITY
3947-13262-0044 BUT AS HE WALKED PAST SALOON AFTER SALOON AND NOTED THE CROWDS GOING IN AND COMING OUT OF THEM AS HE SAW THE WRETCHED DENS AS MANY AS EVER APPARENTLY
3947-13262-0045 HE SICKENED AT THE SIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF ASKING HOW MUCH CLEANSING COULD A MILLION DOLLARS POURED INTO THIS CESSPOOL ACCOMPLISH
3947-13262-0046 WAS NOT THE LIVING SOURCE OF NEARLY ALL THE HUMAN MISERY THEY SOUGHT TO RELIEVE UNTOUCHED AS LONG AS THE SALOONS DID THEIR DEADLY BUT LEGITIMATE WORK
3947-13262-0048 IT WAS THE SAME THAT VIRGINIA HAD PUT TO RACHEL IN HER STATEMENT THAT IN HER OPINION NOTHING REALLY PERMANENT WOULD EVER BE DONE UNTIL THE SALOON WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE RECTANGLE
460-172359-0000 IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
460-172359-0002 AS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE
460-172359-0004 TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0010 THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
460-172359-0011 AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERN
460-172359-0012 IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
460-172359-0015 AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
460-172359-0018 AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
460-172359-0021 THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
460-172359-0022 AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
460-172359-0024 I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
460-172359-0025 THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
460-172359-0031 AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
460-172359-0032 AND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON IT
460-172359-0033 SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
460-172359-0035 CAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIME
460-172359-0039 BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
460-172359-0040 AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
460-172359-0041 AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
460-172359-0043 I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
460-172359-0046 THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
460-172359-0047 THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
460-172359-0048 UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
460-172359-0050 I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
460-172359-0055 EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
460-172359-0056 AND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPS
460-172359-0060 THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
460-172359-0061 ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
460-172359-0064 AND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERT
460-172359-0065 SO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNING
460-172359-0070 BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
460-172359-0071 THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
460-172359-0074 ALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBA
460-172359-0077 LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
460-172359-0079 IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
460-172359-0081 YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
460-172359-0082 THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
460-172359-0084 JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
460-172359-0088 SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
460-172359-0089 HE ASKED ME FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HOW MANY BLIND PEOPLE IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL ONE OF THESE BLIND HOMES AND HOW A FELLER COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM
460-172359-0090 A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
460-172359-0091 BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
460-172359-0093 AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
460-172359-0096 AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
460-172359-0098 JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
460-172359-0099 THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD
4640-19188-0000 CHAPTER FOUR MINUS FIVE PLUS ONE
4640-19188-0001 STILL GREAT AS WAS THIS OMNIPOTENCE A MURMUR AROSE
4640-19188-0002 HE RESUMED HAUGHTILY LET THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF NOT NUMBERING MORE THAN THIRTY SAY SO THE MURMURS REDOUBLED
4640-19188-0003 YOU WOULD FALL IN WITH SOME GRAND GUARD OF THE LINE OR THE SUBURBS
4640-19188-0004 ENTERED THE TAP ROOM THEY EMERGED THENCE A MOMENT LATER
4640-19188-0006 AH YOU WANT TO GET YOURSELVES KILLED SO DO I I WHO AM SPEAKING TO YOU
4640-19188-0008 AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES YOUR NEIGHBORS SUICIDE IS MURDER THINK OF THE LITTLE BLOND HEADS THINK OF THE WHITE LOCKS
4640-19188-0012 WHO SING AND PRATTLE WHO ARE LIKE A LIVING PERFUME WHO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF ANGELS IN HEAVEN BY THE PURITY OF VIRGINS ON EARTH
4640-19188-0013 THOSE ADORABLE AND HONEST CREATURES WHO ARE YOUR BLESSINGS AND YOUR PRIDE AH GOOD GOD THEY WILL SUFFER HUNGER WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO YOU
4640-19188-0022 HE IS DEAD HE WAS TAKEN TO THE NECKER HOSPITAL WHERE I SAW HIM I WAS HOUSE SURGEON IN THAT HOSPITAL
4640-19188-0031 IT IS YOUR DUTY RATHER RETORTED THE MAN YOU HAVE TWO SISTERS WHOM YOU MAINTAIN AND AN UNPRECEDENTED CONTROVERSY BROKE FORTH
4640-19188-0035 DO YOU DESIGNATE WHO IS TO REMAIN YES SAID THE FIVE CHOOSE WE WILL OBEY YOU MARIUS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANOTHER EMOTION
4640-19188-0036 WHICH ONE BEHOLDS IN THE DEPTHS OF HISTORY HOVERING OVER THERMOPYLAE
4640-19188-0038 THE FIFTH MAN WAS SAVED
4640-19188-0040 AND HE HAD SILENTLY REMOVED HIS COAT AND FLUNG IT ON THE PILE WITH THE REST THE EMOTION AROUSED WAS INDESCRIBABLE
4680-16042-0000 IT WAS THE REFLECTION OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS BURNING IN THE CORINTHE BARRICADE MARIUS DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THAT RED LIGHT
4680-16042-0001 HAD PRESERVED WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD AT THE CORNER OF THE LAST HOUSE ON HIS LEFT HE THRUST HIS HEAD FORWARD AND LOOKED INTO THE FRAGMENT OF THE RUE MONDETOUR
4680-16042-0004 MARIUS HAD BUT A STEP MORE TO TAKE
4680-16042-0006 HIS COCKADE BLACKENED WITH POWDER HIS BROW FURROWED WITH HIS HELMET IN BARRACKS IN CAMP IN THE BIVOUAC
4680-16042-0013 IT WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE SCORCHED HIS HANDS AND BURST OUT AFLAME BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE THE SWORD OF THE ANGEL
4680-16042-0015 HAD HE NOT GIVEN HER HIS WORD OF HONOR THAT HE WOULD DIE SHE HAD GONE KNOWING THAT THIS MEANT THAT IT PLEASED HER THAT MARIUS SHOULD DIE AND THEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE NO LONGER LOVED HIM
4680-16042-0020 HE LEFT NONE OF THEM UNANSWERED LET US SEE WHY SHOULD HIS FATHER BE INDIGNANT ARE THERE NOT CASES WHERE INSURRECTION RISES TO THE DIGNITY OF DUTY
4680-16042-0027 THE TENTH OF AUGUST ELECTRIFIES THEM
4680-16042-0029 TREATED ROUGHLY BY THE VERY BENEFIT OF THEIR DELIVERANCE THEIR EYES MUST BE WOUNDED BY THE TRUE LIGHT MUST BE HURLED AT THEM IN TERRIBLE HANDFULS
4680-16042-0030 OF WHOM ARE YOU SPEAKING DO YOU CALL LOUIS PHILIPPE THE TYRANT NO
4680-16042-0033 WHEN THE MASTER FALLS IN FRANCE HE FALLS EVERYWHERE IN SHORT WHAT CAUSE IS MORE JUST AND CONSEQUENTLY WHAT WAR IS GREATER THAN THAT WHICH RE ESTABLISHES SOCIAL TRUTH
5789-70653-0004 AN UNDISTINGUISHED PUBLIC FILLED THE REST OF THE SPACE AND LISTENED IN AN AWED SILENCE TO THE OPENING SOLEMNITIES THE NEWSPAPER MEN WELL USED TO THESE
5789-70653-0005 THE IDENTITY OF THE DEAD MAN WAS PROVED BY HIS WIFE THE FIRST WITNESS CALLED FROM WHOM THE CORONER AFTER SOME INQUIRY INTO THE HEALTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DECEASED
5789-70653-0006 PROCEEDED TO DRAW AN ACCOUNT OF THE LAST OCCASION ON WHICH SHE HAD SEEN HER HUSBAND ALIVE MISSUS MANDERSON WAS TAKEN THROUGH HER EVIDENCE BY THE CORONER
5789-70653-0008 PRODUCED A SINGULAR IMPRESSION THIS WAS NOT AN IMPRESSION OF HARDNESS INTERESTING FEMININITY WAS THE FIRST THING TO BE FELT IN HER PRESENCE SHE WAS NOT EVEN ENIGMATIC
5789-70653-0009 BUT HER VOICE WAS LOW AND CLEAR TO THE END HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD COME UP TO HIS BEDROOM ABOUT HIS USUAL HOUR FOR RETIRING ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT
5789-70653-0012 SHE HAD NO CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID AS SHE HAD BEEN VERY DROWSY AT THE TIME BUT SHE HAD REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT FOR A MOONLIGHT RUN IN THE CAR
5789-70653-0013 AND WHAT TIME IT WAS SHE HAD ASKED WHAT THE TIME WAS
5789-70653-0019 THE QUESTION I AM GOING TO PUT TO YOU MUST IN THESE SAD CIRCUMSTANCES BE A PAINFUL ONE
5789-70653-0020 IS IT THE FACT THAT YOUR RELATIONS WITH YOUR LATE HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN FOR SOME TIME PAST RELATIONS OF MUTUAL AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE
5789-70653-0023 SOMETHING WAS BETWEEN US I DID NOT KNOW WHAT AND HE NEVER TOLD ME MY OWN OBSTINATE PRIDE PREVENTED ME FROM ASKING WHAT IT WAS IN SO MANY WORDS
5789-70653-0025 THEN WAS THERE NEVER ANYTHING OF THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY CALL WORDS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND MA'AM NEVER
5789-70653-0029 BUT HE DID NOT LOOK AT MARTIN HE WAS OBSERVING THE WELL BALANCED FIGURE THAT CAME QUICKLY TOWARD HIM ALONG AN OPENING PATH IN THE CROWD AND HIS EYE WAS GLOOMY
6272-70171-0003 ROSVILLE WAS LARGER AND HANDSOMER THAN SURREY THAT IS MY HOUSE ON THE RIGHT HE SAID WE LOOKED DOWN THE SHADY STREET THROUGH WHICH WE WERE GOING
6272-70171-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE STREAM OF LIGHT OVER THE CARPET I THOUGHT IT SOMBER AND OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE COTTAGE EXTERIOR
6272-70171-0019 I THINK THEY WOULD GRUMBLE AND ADMIRE LOOK AT THIS SHOWING HER THE TASSELS OF THE INNER WINDOW CURTAINS DONE UP IN LITTLE BAGS AND THE GLASS IS PINNED UP WITH NICE YELLOW PAPER
6272-70171-0021 IT WAS BYRON AND TURNING OVER THE LEAVES TILL I CAME TO DON JUAN I READ IT THROUGH
6272-70171-0022 WHICH WAS NOT THE ONE WE HAD TAKEN TEA IN BUT A SMALL APARTMENT WITH A DOOR OPENING INTO THE GARDEN
6272-70171-0026 I SAID MOTHER TRIED IN VAIN TO LOOK HARD HEARTED AND TO PERSUADE THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR ME BUT SHE LOST HER APPETITE WITH THE THOUGHT OF LOSING ME WHICH THE MENTION OF DOCTOR PRICE BROUGHT HOME
6272-70171-0027 THE HAM WAS MOST SAVORY BUT CUT IN SUCH THIN SLICES THAT IT CURLED AND THE BISCUITS WERE AS WHITE AND FEATHERY AS SNOWFLAKES
6272-70171-0028 COUSIN ALICE GAVE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO EDWARD WHO ATE AS LITTLE AS THE REST MOTHER I SAID AFTERWARD
6272-70171-0040 THINK HOW MUCH GREATER YOUR ADVANTAGES ARE THAN MINE HAVE EVER BEEN HOW MISERABLE WAS MY YOUTH IT IS TOO LATE FOR ME TO MAKE ANY ATTEMPT AT CULTIVATION I HAVE NO WISH THAT WAY
